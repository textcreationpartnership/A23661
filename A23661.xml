         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ch indeed hath been written of the Divine Aſſiſtance in parts, and upon occaſion of handling other doctrines, ſuch as Repentance, Faith, Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet I cannot ſay that much hath been done by any entire and ſet Diſcourſe upon this Subject, eſpecially not upon Gods preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace and preparatory aſſiſtance; which yet is one branch of the whole, and
<pb facs="tcp:96825:3"/>hugely neceſſary to be well underſtood and conſidered. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which account I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think that ſomething further of this nature, though but vulgarly done, may be of good uſe to Vulgar capacities, who can better underſtand this great Doctrine when they ſee the parts put together, and how they relate to, and depend one upon another, than otherwiſe they can.</p>
            <p>And therefore the better to prepare the Reader for the enſuing Diſcourſe, I ſhall inſtance in ſome few things, to ſhew the uſefulneſs of a clear and diſtinct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Nature and Method of Divine Aſſiſtance, and the terms on which it may be expected.</p>
            <p>And firſt touching the <hi>Method</hi> of Gods aſſiſtance. It is endeavoured in the following Diſcourſe to ſhew, that God by his preventing grace uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with men, in aſſiſting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performance of the condition of the promiſe, by raiſing in them a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of their guilt and danger, and by awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
<pb facs="tcp:96825:3"/>their fear; and all to ſtir them up to apply themſelves to the remedy. For Fear being a moſt powerful princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſpring of Action, when any thing ſtrong, will, if any thing will, put them upon endeavours to provide for their own ſafety. But if men be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unacquainted with this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Gods aſſiſtance, they will be in much danger of taking theſe firſt operations of God upon their minds, to be but like other thoughts which come and go there, without being much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of: or elſe but for a fit of Melancholy, to be withſtood and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt; and ſo unawares they may quench the Spirit under the notion of removing Melancholy thoughts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they were made ſenſible of the Nature of Gods Preparatory Aſſiſtance, they would probably be more afraid to ſlight ſuch working of their thoughts, leſt in doing ſo they ſhould ſlight the warning of God himſelf, and the ſafety of their own ſouls.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96825:4"/>
            <p>The knowledge of this Method of Gods Aſſiſtance, ſerves alſo to direct thoſe who labour the converſion of ſouls, and to help on the Work of Repentance in men, frequently to inculcate upon the minds of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreformed Sinners, ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and conſiderations as are apt and proper to make them ſenſible of their guilt and danger, and to awaken their fears. For when by their doing ſo, theſe applications from without by the Word, meet with Gods applications to the mind by his Spirit within, the operation will be ſo much the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the more likely to prevail.</p>
            <p>And becauſe men are too apt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves of ſuch fears as much as they can, by ſome vain and deluſive reaſonings in their minds: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a reſolution to become new men hereafter, though they delay it for the preſent, is one of them; therefore to prevent this, the greatneſs of the folly, and the greatneſs of the danger of ſuch a delay, ſhould be ſtrenuouſly urged upon
<pb facs="tcp:96825:4"/>them, as a Folly ſo great, that the folly of thoſe that ſee their whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, or their Lives in apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and yet do not make all the haſte they can to ſecure them, is no folly in compariſon of this. For they are not onely in danger thereby of being eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt, by being ſnatched away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a delay, but alſo of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all Divine Aſſiſtance for the future, although they ſhould live never ſo long. <hi>For from him that hath not (i. e.</hi> hath not uſed that which he firſt had) <hi>ſhall be taken away that which he hath,</hi> ſaith our Saviour.</p>
            <p>Bad men are apt to flatter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves with this opinion alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that they have no power to be better, or to perform the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor never had, and that they cannot be better till God give them of his grace to be ſo, by giving them more power to that end, than ever yet he gave them: and that it is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with his Mercy, nor with his
<pb facs="tcp:96825:5"/>Juſtice, neither to deſtroy men for not doing that which he never gave them power to do: from both which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are apt to conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſafe condition, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Chriſt died for them, though otherwiſe they are apparently vicious in their lives.</p>
            <p>But if they would but underſtand the Method and Order of Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Nature and Terms of it, they would find themſelves under a great and dangerous miſtake. For the very Reaſon which they urge as part of the ground of their confidence of the ſafeneſs of their condition, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not conſiſtent with the Mercy, nor with the Juſtice of God to deſtroy men for not doing that which he never gave them power to do, is a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that he doth give ſuch men whom he deſtroys before he deſtroys them, power to do that for the not doing of which he doth deſtroy them; and conſequently that he hath given ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:96825:5"/>bad men, as reaſon, as aforeſaid, power to have been better, and that therefore the mercifulneſs of God can be no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to them of not being deſtroyed, until they become better. If this were not ſo, it would follow, that either none ſhould periſh, or that it is inconſiſtent with the Mercy and Juſtice of God that they do, according to the tenor of theſe mens reaſoning. Both which are equally falſe, and the latter blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous alſo. And therefore it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and abſurd way of reaſoning, for ſuch men to conclude that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they are no better, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath not given them power to be ſo.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven power unto men that are bad, to have been better neceſſarily and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably; for if he had, they could not have been ſo bad as now they are. Nor do I ſay that God hath given ſuch men an immediate power to do all that which belongs unto a compleat perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb facs="tcp:96825:6"/>of the condition of the promiſe, but he gives them a remote power to do it, by giving them an immediate power to begin it. And if they do but make uſe of this power by an actual beginning to perform this condition, as they may, God will then give them ſo much more of it, as whereby they may finiſh it, unleſs they refuſe to make uſe of it. So that if men do not perform the condition of the promiſe, it is not for want of power, but for want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of that power which God hath already given them by his preventing grace; otherwiſe their deſtruction would not be of themſelves, which yet it is, as all grant.</p>
            <p>There are none but upon that awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening which they have had from God one way, and one time or other, might out of a dread of him, and of his wrath revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of men, have begun to reform and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs ſinful by leaving off ſome ill
<pb facs="tcp:96825:6"/>practices; and they would have found they could have done ſo, in caſe they had been ſure they ſhould have loſt their Lives or Eſtates preſently if they had not. Though they had not power all on a ſudden to become good, yet they had power through Gods preventing grace not to have been ſo bad. The worſt of men doubtleſs had power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch time as by their obſtinacy and oppoſition againſt God and his dealing with them they ſinned it away, to have reformed in part: which to have done out of a dread of God, would have been a beginning to repent, and ſo a beginning to perform the condition of the promiſe of pardon. The men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> by the awakening of their fears by the preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> could we ſee <hi>turn from their evil ways,</hi> and in particular, <hi>from the violence that was in their hands, Jonah 3.8, 10.</hi> And by the ſame aſſiſtance and power by which men may become leſs bad, they may be able alſo to make more uſe than they have done of the means of Grace, and
<pb facs="tcp:96825:7"/>to become poſitively better thereby to a degree. Which if they do, and do not by ſeeking out vain reaſonings and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, obliterate that <hi>ſenſe</hi> by which they began to be better, God will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with more power to proceed in the Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> until it come to a Work of <hi>Renovation</hi> of the whole man, both in heart and life, and therein unto a performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>And as it is we ſee, matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the people be made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Method of Divine Aſſiſtance, ſo is it of no leſs concernment for them to underſtand upon what terms it may be expected; as whether upon previous conditions or without. For if it be not to be expected but upon conditions to be performed on our part, and yet we think otherwiſe, we ſhall be in extream great danger of depriving our ſelves of that aſſiſtance, by neglecting what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us, to make our ſelves capable of it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96825:7"/>
            <p>And therefore for a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter, we muſt diſtinguiſh between ſuch an aſſiſtance as is onely preparatory to a farther aſſiſtance, and that by means of which, the condition of the Promiſe is compleatly performed. And if we do, we ſhall find that the preparatory aſſiſtance is indeed affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto men without any condition at all, ſave what our Saviour hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his Mediatorial obedience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it for us. And this Preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſiſtance is that which we call Gods Preventing Grace, becauſe by it he prevents all endeavours on our part to make our ſelves capable of it. For he is aforehand with us in giving us the Goſpel, and the Miniſtry of it, who live where it is; and ſo he is by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret operations upon our minds to make us ſenſible of our danger, thereby to ſtir us up to bethink our ſelves how we may eſcape it: and all this before we do any thing our ſelves with an intent to raiſe ſuch a ſenſe or conſideration in our ſelves.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96825:8"/>
            <p>But although Gods Preparatory Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Preventing Grace is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto men without any condition, yet his <hi>farther</hi> Aſſiſtance is promiſed but upon condition of making uſe of his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> When God hath been at work in mens minds to make them ſenſible of the danger of their ſinful ſtate and bad tendency of their evil ways, and hath laid before them how they may eſcape it; if yet they will not make ſo much uſe of all this, as thereupon to concern themſelves more than they had done about the affairs of their Souls and another World, they can have no reaſon to promiſe themſelves any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance from God; nor can they be ſure to have any repetition of the firſt. For our Saviour hath told us, ſaying, <hi>What meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured unto you: and to you that hear more ſhall be given. Mark 4.24.</hi> According to what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we mete in the attendance, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attendance of our minds to make uſe of thoſe aids and aſſiſtances which God
<pb facs="tcp:96825:8"/>affords us, it will be meaſured to us in affording, or not affording us more And when he ſays, that unto you tha hear, more ſhall be given, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand more thereby, than that the promiſe of more aſſiſtance is made, but onely to ſuch as do attend to what God hath already admoniſhed them of, and who have ſo far taken into conſideration what he hath ſaid or done to them by his Word, and by his Works of Providence without, and by the awakening operations of his Spirit within, as not to ſlight them, but to be inclined thereby to be more mindful and ſolicitous about their Salvation, than ever they were before.</p>
            <p>And that our Saviours words afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, <hi>To you that hear, more ſhall be given,</hi> are to be underſtood in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſenſe; that is, that more ſhall be given upon condition of attending to what had been done before, is evident by his next words, <hi>verſe 25. For he that hath, to him more ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:96825:9"/>and he that hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that which he hath:</hi> that is, (as will be ſhewed in the following Diſcourſe) from him that hath not uſed and improved that which was firſt given him, ſhall be taken away that which he already had, rather than have any more given him. By which aſſertion of our Saviour, it appears that this is a Law of Heaven, a rule which Almighty God is reſolved ordinarily to obſerve in diſpenſing his aſſiſtances unto men, that thoſe who do not make ſome good uſe of his preventing grace, his former aſſiſtance, ſhall after ſome time of trial have that ſuſpended, and the current of it ſtopt. As on the other hand they that do, ſhall have more of it given them. And if they make a good uſe of that <hi>more</hi> alſo, they ſhall have more added to that other more, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of aſſiſtance added to the firſt, and a third to the ſecond, and ſo on. For God is and will be lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way, he will be aforehand with us in his aſſiſtances; and if we do but
<pb facs="tcp:96825:9"/>follow him in our endeavours to make uſe of them, he will ſtill afford us more and more, until he hath carried us up to a good degree towards perfection. He is ſtill working in us to will and to do; that is, to will better and to do better by aſſiſting us ſo to do: and if we do but work too, as he expects we ſhould, by making uſe of his aſſiſtances to work out our own ſalvation, the great buſineſs of of our Salvation will go on proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p>This, I doubt not, is the <hi>truth</hi> which lies in the middle way, between the two contrary extreams of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> on the one hand, and the opinion of <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible</hi> Grace on the other; into one of which, men will be in great danger to fall, if they do not underſtand the Nature and Terms of Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>The right underſtanding and due conſideration of this Doctrine of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, is very neceſſary alſo
<pb facs="tcp:96825:10"/>to make us all thoroughly <hi>ſenſible</hi> how much the work of grace from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to its greateſt growth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, depends upon the Divine <hi>aids.</hi> Though it is not Gods Method to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert men without their own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and uſe of the means appointed and vouchſafed by him, yet the ſucceſs of ſuch endeavours depends upon the concurrent operation and influence of the Spirit of God. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, and We likewiſe uſe our endeavours, but yet it is <hi>God that gives the increaſe,</hi> and cauſes them to proſper. Nay it is God, who by his Preventing Grace does firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in us that, from which all our endeavours of this nature do ſpring: for it is <hi>God that worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. <hi>2.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever therefore our endeavours may be, and how excellent ſoever the External means are which are vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed us for the begetting or increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb facs="tcp:96825:10"/>of Grace, yet it is not ſafe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon theſe for either (otherwiſe than as they are means by which God conveys his Grace to us) but upon the gracious and powerful operation of God by thoſe means. And that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why in the uſe of all means, we are to ſeek unto God by Prayer, for ſomewhat beyond what he hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the means or inſtruments of Grace onely as ſuch. Hence <hi>building up our ſelves in our moſt Holy Faith, and praying in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, <hi>Jude 20.</hi> What made the Goſpel to make ſo ſtrange an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the World on a ſudden as it did in the minds and manners of men upon its firſt ſetting forth after our Saviours aſcenſion? but that mighty preſence of the Spirit that accompanied it unto the minds of men. We cannot ſay it was onely becauſe of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that kept pace with it, which yet were wrought by the power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For how little did the numerous and marvelous Miracles of our Saviour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb facs="tcp:96825:11"/>(though he ſpake alſo as never man ſpake) until the time came that the Spirit was poured out in greater abundance as well on the Hearers as on the Preachers of the Goſpel. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their ſpiritual Warfare did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>pluck down ſtrong holds, caſt down imaginations, and every high thing that exalted it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God;</hi> but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Weapons of their Warfare were mighty through God;</hi> that is, through the mightineſs of his operation that went along with them, <hi>2 Cor. 10.4, 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of how much the Work of Grace depends upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, proceeds from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſideration of the <hi>nature</hi> of it; ſo our <hi>Application</hi> to God, and <hi>Dependence</hi> upon him for it, depends upon the ſame knowledge and ſenſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. For unleſs men have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe, as of their need of Grace, and of the neceſſity of their performing
<pb facs="tcp:96825:11"/>the condition of the Promiſe in order to their obtaining the benefits promiſed, ſo unleſs they have ſome ſenſe alſo of the neceſſity of Divine Aſſiſtance to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that condition, and of the terms on which they may have it, they will neither deſire theſe things, nor uſe Gods appointed means to obtain them, nor depend upon him for them in the uſe of means. But by how much the more ſenſe they have of their need of theſe things, and of Gods willingneſs to aſſiſt them in the uſe of means for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, and of his willingneſs to confer them upon ſuch terms, by ſo much will they apply themſelves to God for them, and to the uſe of the means by which he conveys them, and in doing ſo depend upon him for them. And by how much they do thus, by ſo much they are likely to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> and to be taken out of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World, and to be acted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Spirit, and to have their hearts lifted up in the way of the Lord. For the Holy Spirit will moſt certainly be
<pb facs="tcp:96825:12"/>given unto ſuch who out of a ſenſe of their great need of it, and of its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and uſefulneſs, do earneſtly, beg it of God, and depend upon him for it, in a conſcientious uſe of that aſſiſtance they have already received. For our bleſſed Saviour hath aſſured us that the <hi>Heavenly Father will much more, and much ſooner give the Holy Spirit to thoſe that ask it, than earthly parents will give good gifts unto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Luke <hi>11.13. I love them that love me, and they that ſeek me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall find me,</hi> ſaith the Wiſdom of God, and is truly applicable unto the Spirit of God, Prov. <hi>8.17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by how much we are made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that all our Chriſtian performances depend upon the Divine Aſſiſtance, by ſo much the leſs we are in danger of tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in our own ſtrength, or of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting them to our ſelves: and by ſo much we are likely alſo to aſcribe them all to God, and to ſay with <hi>David, of thine own we have given thee,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96825:12"/>and with the other Prophet, <hi>Thou Lord haſt wrought all our works in us;</hi> and accordingly to love and to praiſe him for all his aids.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, The knowledge of the Doctrine of Divine Aſſiſtance, is of great uſe likewiſe to animate and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us in the way of our duty, againſt the diſcouragements we meet with in it, from the difficulties of performing it, and oppoſitions againſt us in it. For by the Doctrine of the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Divine Aſſiſtance, we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if we do but in good earneſt ſet about our duty in performing the condition of the Promiſe, our ability to perform it will increaſe upon our hands, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength; and to him that hath more ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi> And by how much our ſtrength doth increaſe through the Divine Aſſiſtance, by ſo much the work will grow more and more eaſie, and the difficulty wear off. That which
<pb facs="tcp:96825:13"/>is with difficulty done by one, while he hath but the ſtrength of a child, will be done with eaſe and pleaſure when he grows towards the ſtrength of a man. And although we meet with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and temptation to turn us back again after we have ſet out, (and uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greateſt difficulty is found in our entrance upon the work, while we are unaccuſtomed to it, while our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are yet ſtrong, and our ſtrength but little) yet if we do but hold on our way, and rally again as oft as we we receive any foils, we ſhall be ſure to overcome at laſt, and come off with compleat Victory; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> as S. John ſaith, <hi>greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the World.</hi> And though our <hi>beginning be but ſmall, yet our latter end ſhall greatly increaſe.</hi> It is ſaid of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>that a bruiſed Reed he ſhall not break, and ſmoaking Flax he ſhall not quench, until he ſend forth judgment unto victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96825:13"/>
            <p>And thus we ſee how very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the due knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the nature and method of Divine Aſſiſtance, and of the terms on which we may expect it.</p>
            <p>The better underſtanding, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical uſe of all which by ſuch whoſe abilities do not ſet them above it, is the deſign of the following Diſcourſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>How God prepares men towards perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the condition of the Promiſe, by cauſing Principles of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to operate on the Mind.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALmighty God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour have thus far preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all endeavours of ours towards the bringing about our Salvation: The Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Son to be the Saviour of the World, and the Son hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96825:17"/>a Ranſom for all, and taſted Death for every man: and upon account of his Death and Paſſion, a Promiſe is made to all men of pardon of Sin and eternal Life, upon condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, and ſincere Obedience. And God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are not onely ready, willing and deſirous to <hi>aſſiſt us to perform this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> but do actually aſſiſt even thoſe towards it to a degree, and until that aſſiſtance is refuſed, oppoſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, who yet periſh for want onely of performing that condition.</p>
               <p>Now this Divine Aſſiſtance which men receive in performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which Pardon and Life are promiſed, is intended to be the ſubject matter of this Diſcourſe. In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon which I ſhall ſuppoſe and take for granted, that the promiſe of the pardon of Sin and eternal Life, is conditional; and that Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſincere Obedience, make up the whole of this condition.</p>
               <p>And that we may the better come to underſtand the nature, manner, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96825:17"/>method of this <hi>Divine Aſſiſtance,</hi> I ſhall endeavour two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew what is done by God by way of <hi>Preparation,</hi> to prepare and diſpoſe the minds of men to perform the condition of the Promiſe, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, Believing, and in ſincerely obeying the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew what is done by God to aſſiſt them in that performance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo prepared.</p>
               <p>That ſomething is done by God by way of <hi>Preparation,</hi> without which no man does ſavingly believe in Chriſt, I gather from our Saviours own words in <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And again, Ver. 65. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come to me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</hi> And in Verſe 45. thus, <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Theſe ſayings of our Saviour ſhew that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be done upon men by God the Father, before they can repair to Chriſt, as to the great Maſter that hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96825:18"/>the <hi>words of eternal life,</hi> as reſolving to be ruled and governed by his Doctrine and Precepts in ſeeking Salvation; or which is the ſame, before they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his real and true Diſciples or Scholars in learning practically of him the way to eternal life: for that is it I underſtand by coming to Chriſt. And this, according to our Saviours do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, no man can do, that is not firſt prepared for it by the Father, by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and learning of him, and by being drawn by him.</p>
               <p>Now what effect upon the Soul that is, or what temper of mind it is which is cauſed by the Fathers teaching, and which does prepare men ſo as that they come to Chriſt thereupon, is not here ſaid in the fore-cited words of our Saviour. But we may be able to make ſome judgment of it, after two or three things are conſidered, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words direct us to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not Faith it ſelf, as having Chriſt for its object. For coming to Chriſt, or believing in him, is the effect of that temper of mind which is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96825:18"/>wrought by the Fathers teaching and drawing here ſpoken of, or at leaſt is conſequent to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This temper of mind wrought by the Fathers teaching or operation, is ſuch in the nature of it, as does incline and diſpoſe men to come to Chriſt, and to believe in him, though it be not that coming to him it ſelf, nor that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him. <hi>For every man that hath heard and learned of the Father, does come to the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This temper of mind is ſuch an effect, and that by which it is wrought ſuch an act, as is moſt properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto God the Father. It is that which comes by mens learning of the <hi>Father,</hi> it is that by which the <hi>Father</hi> draws them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind then which does moſt incline and diſpoſe men to come to Chriſt and to believe in him, to embrace the grace offered through him and by him, and to ſubmit to the terms on which it is offered, muſt needs be that effect upon the Soul which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96825:19"/>here ſpeaks of, without which no man can come to him.</p>
               <p>And this I conceive we ſhall find to be a <hi>ſtrong ſenſe</hi> upon the mind of the guilt of ſin, and of a liableneſs to Gods wrath thereby, accompanied with a fear of it, and with anxiety of mind, about ones future ſtate after death, and likewiſe a ſenſe of the different tendency of moral righteouſneſs and goodneſs, and a teachable frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as the effect and conſequence of ſuch a <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that uneaſineſs of mind which the foreſaid ſenſe cauſeth, begets a teachable frame of Spirit, makes men willing to hearken to thoſe terms which are offered in the Goſpel, to free them from the foreſaid fears, pain, and anxiety of mind. The ſenſe I ſpeak of, and the pain cauſed thereby, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails againſt thoſe <hi>prejudices</hi> by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing them, which men before and till then, had againſt thoſe terms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubmitting to which, Pardon and Salvation are not to be had, and makes them willing to accept of them. Though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96825:19"/>while they are but in the way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to perform the condition of the Promiſe, they are not come ſo far as to chuſe to ſubmit to that condition out of love to thoſe things of which it does conſiſt, yet their ſenſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the pain of fear of falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, may incline them to think their ſubmitting to the condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much more tolerable and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than their ſenſe of danger, and pain of fear is, which is upon them; and that will diſpoſe them to take ſuch things into conſideration, as will in a little time reconcile their minds and wills to thoſe things in which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promiſe doth conſiſt: and if it do but that, yet it is preparatory to that performance.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>ſenſe</hi> of guilt and danger, and of the better tendency of moral righteouſneſs and goodneſs, may be raiſed in the mind by the operation of principles of natural religion, when God is pleaſed to ſet them home, and to make the force and power of them to be felt, as I ſhall after ſhew. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96825:20"/>that may be the reaſon why all this preparatory work upon the mind, is aſcribed unto God the Father, as we ſee it is by our Saviour. For natural Religion and the eſſects of it upon the mind, are moſt properly aſcribed unto God the Father; and the reaſon is, becauſe natural Religion was planted by him in the nature of man before the Fall, while ſupernatural Religion by the Mediator had not yet any being in men. And preparation for Religion ſupernaturally revealed (as the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of believing in Chriſt is) may well be aſcribed unto our being taught by natural Religion, becauſe Religion ſupernatural, is founded in that which is natural. Men muſt firſt believe the Being of God and his Attributes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can believe ſupernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations to be from him, and ſo to be undoubtedly true. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
               <p>Men may indeed be prepared by the Father to come to Chriſt, by ſome of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96825:20"/>the ſame doctrines which our Saviour himſelf taught, when powerfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon the mind, and yet this be done by principles of natural Religion, becauſe a great part of his doctrine is the ſame with natural Religion; onely natural religion is more perceptible by his doctrine, than while onely in the dark minds of men. He came, as he himſelf ſays, <hi>not to deſtroy, but to fill up the Law;</hi> to make a more compleat diſcovery of the latitude and ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the natural Law, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets had done, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. But the Fathers teaching and drawing, mentioned by our Saviour, being but to prepare men to receive principles purely evangelical, it cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be thought to be done by ſuch, but by thoſe which are natural.</p>
               <p>To believe then the being of God and his Attributes, the Immortality of the Soul, and a future ſtate, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tendency of moral good and evil, and the Rewards and Puniſhments in another World, are principles of natural Religion. And a powerful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96825:21"/>of theſe Principles upon the minds of guilty perſons by Almighty God, hath a great tendency in it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and diſpoſe them for a belief of the Goſpel, when made known to them with the evidence of its divinity; and that in a double reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As they come to be convinced thereby of the guilt of ſin and of their obnoxiouſneſs by that to the wrath of Almighty God, and to be anxiouſly concerned in their own minds about their future ſtate after death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they come thereby to a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcerning of the nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of moral righteouſneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such a powerful impreſſion upon the mind, of principles of natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as I have ſaid, prepares men for a belief in Chriſt, as they come thereby to be convinced of their guiltineſs and of their obnoxiouſneſs by that unto the wrath of Almighty God, and to be anxiouſly concerned in their own minds about their future ſtate after death.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96825:21"/>
               <p>The natural operation of natural conſcience, doth ſomething to make men ſenſible of the guilt of ſin and of their liableneſs to divine diſpleaſure thereby. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that had not the Law, ſaith that their <hi>thoughts did accuſe them,</hi> when ſin was committed againſt the dictates of the light and law of Nature; and that their <hi>conſcience did bear them witneſs</hi> that ſuch accuſations were true, <hi>they knew the judgment of God that thoſe who did ſuch things were worthy of death, Rom.</hi> 2.15. and 1.32. The conſequence of all which, when ſet home upon the mind by God by a vigorous operation, muſt needs be diſquietneſs, fear, and anxiety of mind, and doubtful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions touching Gods diſpleaſure and the future ſtate.</p>
               <p>And that the very Heathen were upon this account in an uneaſie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and under diſquieting apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the divine diſpleaſure, appears by the many ſacrifices which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to attone God, and to appeaſe the clamour of their own conſciences.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96825:22"/>And well might their condition be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſie to their minds, while they were certain of their liableneſs to the divine diſpleaſure, but ignorant and uncertain of any remedy againſt it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes their condition to be ſuch as that they were <hi>without hope, Eph.</hi> 2.12. that they <hi>were darkneſs,</hi> not knowing whither they were going, or what would become of them at laſt. They had nothing of revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whereby to know with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that God would pardon them upon repentance. And therefore their future ſtate muſt needs have hung in doubt before them, and have cauſed fear day and night.</p>
               <p>From this fear and doubtfulneſs of mind doubtleſs it was, that beſides their Sacrifices, they ran into ſo many other ſuperſtitions as they did, as hoping by them to appeaſe the diſpleaſure of God, and to make ſome compenſation for their offences againſt him, as by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing themſelves for them by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which they exerciſed upon their own bodies, and ſometimes upon their own children.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96825:22"/>
               <p>I mention theſe things, to ſhew in what anxiety of mind the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were, by reaſon of the operation of natural conſcience under the ſenſe of their guilt of ſin, and of their obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſneſs to God thereby. And this ſenſe, and theſe fears, as the effect of natural conſcience, were increaſed and heightned, as it pleaſed God by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret operation upon the mind, to give weight unto them; as we may eaſily conceive by what befel <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in that caſe, when they were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as they were, to bear the laſhings of their own conſciences.</p>
               <p>Nor could their Sacrifices give that caſe to their guilty conſciences which they ſought for by them, unleſs they could have diſcerned more of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them to the nature of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal God which made Heaven and Earth, than they could with any great confidence fanſie there was, to make compenſation to him for their offences. Thoſe Sacrifices which the Jews of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from time to time, though by Gods own appointment, could never
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96825:23"/>make thoſe for whom they were offer'd <hi>perfect as pertaining to the conſcience,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. They could not <hi>purge the conſcience</hi> from thoſe fears and troubleſome apprehenſions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the ſenſe of the guilt of ſin raiſed in them. For which cauſe they, and not onely ſinners of the Gentiles, <hi>were through fear of death, all their life time ſubject unto bondage,</hi> as not knowing for all thoſe Sacrifices, what the event and conſequence of death might be unto guilty perſons obnoxious to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, theſe impreſſions of natural Religion, are not made by God on all men alike, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all are not alike awakened by them: though none I preſume are without fears and doubts more or leſs, about their future ſtate, until they are cured of them, by living up to principles of revealed religion, or elſe by a deſperate courſe of ſinning, have ſinned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a kind of <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> and become <hi>paſt feeling.</hi> And then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they may through <hi>ſearedneſs of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96825:23"/>conſcience,</hi> come to have little or no feeling of thoſe diſquieting effects of the guilt of ſin, where of I ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But men do not come to this until they have greatly neglected, and not attended to this teaching of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by impreſſions of natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; not until they have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to put all thoughts about their future ſtate, and their liableneſs to Gods diſpleaſure out of their minds, that they might be no more troubled with them.</p>
               <p>But when men will needs deal thus from time to time with God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and bid God himſelf and all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts about another World, depart from them; then indeed God many times withdraws his ſecret way of working upon their minds by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful impreſſions of natural Religion, (yea and of revealed Religion too in like caſe) and leaves them to fall into that ſpiritual <hi>ſlumber or ſleep</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. By which ſleep the inward ſenſes of their ſouls are bound up, as the bodily ſenſes in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96825:24"/>ſleep are; ſo that they no more hear, ſee feel or perceive in a ſpiritual ſenſe what God ſays or does to them, than a man in a natural ſleep does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what is ſpoken or done to him.</p>
               <p>But this is not the caſe of thoſe whom the Father by his teaching draws to Chriſt: he keeps their conſcience wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and makes ſin uneaſie to them by the fears it raiſes in their minds, of what may be the event of all at laſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch an operation of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind, as I have been ſpeaking of, hath certainly a tendency in it to draw men to Chriſt, when ſufficiently revealed, and to make them willing to receive the Goſpel, and to become his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon hereof is taken from the <hi>ſuilableneſs</hi> that is between the minds of men ſo affected, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Men ſo prepared by the Fathers teaching, are ſenſible of the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and dangerous condition into which Sin hath brought them. And nothing can be more acceptable to ſuch than a diſcovery and offer of that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96825:24"/>which will give eaſe unto their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thoughts and doubtful minds; and this the Goſpel of Chriſt is exactly fitted and provided to do.</p>
               <p>This Goſpel diſcovers unto them that the guilt of ſin, as to the penal part, is taken away by the Son of God, and by his ſuffering for them. This Goſpel contains a Proclamation from Heaven, publiſhing and declaring Gods willingneſs upon the account of his Sons ſuffering for them, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to, and to pardon all ſinners whatſoever, that will but ceaſe from their wilful rebellion againſt him, and come under his Sons moſt gentle and gracious government, his eaſie yoke, and light burden.</p>
               <p>Such good news as this, was a <hi>ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table good</hi> to ſuch as were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doubts and fears whether God would not prove an enemy to them at laſt, who had carried it as enemies to him all along, and avenge himſelf on them for their oppoſition againſt him. This is a <hi>good</hi> ſo <hi>ſuitable</hi> to ſuch, that nothing could give eaſe to their minds
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96825:25"/>like it. All the things this World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, can no more do it, than ſilver and gold can eaſe the pain of hunger and thirſt, when food is denied. It is the ſuitableneſs of the Goſpel, and a mind ſo prepared as I have ſhewed, that draws men to Chriſt, when the Goſpel reveals him for ſuch a Saviour as he is.</p>
               <p>This is that which makes the very Meſſengers which bring the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpel, acceptable to ſuch for their meſſage ſake. <hi>How beautiful,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, are thee feet of them which preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things? Rom.</hi> 10.15. And how beautiful were his feet in the eyes of the <hi>Galatian</hi> Gentiles, when he firſt brought the Goſpel among them? who before were in fear and doubt about their future ſtate and without hope: I ſay, how beautiful were his feet upon this account, when they <hi>received him as an Angel of God, yea as Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as he himſelf ſaith, and counted <hi>the bleſſedneſs</hi> ſo great, that as he ſays, <hi>they could, if it had been
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96825:25"/>poſſible, have plucked out their own eyes and have given them unto him, Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15.</p>
               <p>The news of ſuch a Saviour as the Goſpel declares him to be, is to ſuch as are in darkneſs and anxiety of mind concerning their future ſtate after death, like the Day-Star and Riſing Sun to ſuch as have been in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortableneſs of a gloomy and dark night. Hence he is ſtiled the <hi>bright and morning Star,</hi> the <hi>Day-Spring from on high, the Sun of Righteouſneſs that does ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angel which firſt publiſhed the Birth of Chriſt to the Shepherds, ſaid, <hi>Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all People, Luke</hi> 2.10. And ſo the Goſpel hath proved to be, eſpecially to thoſe who have been prepared to receive it, by being concerned in their own minds how they ſhould do to be ſaved. Thus when our Saviour preached the Goſpel firſt in <hi>Galilee,</hi> it is ſaid that then <hi>the People ſaw a great light, and to them who ſate in the region of the ſhadow of death,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96825:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>light was ſprung up, Mat.</hi> 4. So ſuch as were <hi>pricked</hi> in their hearts through a ſenſe of guilt and danger, <hi>gladly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> the Word, which brought them tidings of remiſſion of ſin through Chriſt upon Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 42. Thus again, when the Goſpel was firſt preached in <hi>Samaria,</hi> it is ſaid <hi>there was great joy in that City, Act.</hi> 8. The Gentiles alſo when they had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel firſt preached unto them at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, they were glad and glorified the Word of the Lord, Act.</hi> 13.47.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel was not ſo welcome to all where it came; and what was the reaſon it was not as well as to others? The reaſon was, becauſe they had not learned by the Fathers teaching, as ſome had done, but ſtifled the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of natural light in their minds, and had laboured to lay their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences aſleep again, after at any time they had been awakened by God. They laboured to put thoughts about their future ſtate out of their minds becauſe they found them troubleſom unto them. <hi>They cloſed their eyes and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96825:26"/>ſtopped their ears</hi> againſt any thing that tended to awaken them.</p>
               <p>But all did not ſo, but remained thoughtful about their future ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, when God once had awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened them by ſtrong impreſſions of natural Religion to be concerned in their own minds about it. And they were ſuch as theſe who were wont to receive the Goſpel, and believe it when it came among them. As we ſee for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe Gentiles to whom <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. For it is ſaid of them, <hi>As many as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life, believed.</hi> Or, as others from the Greek read it, <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were diſpoſed to, or for eternal life, believed:</hi> that is, as I, after others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, As many as were ordered, or whoſe thoughts were ordered, and minds diſpoſed for eternal life; that is, to look after eternal life, theſe were the People that believed.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Goſpel was deſign'd in chief, as it ſhould ſeem, for thoſe whoſe hearts and minds are bruiſed or broken with fears and cares about
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96825:27"/>their Salvation. For thus run the words of that Propheſie which was fulfilled in the Publication of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by Chriſt. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the Poor, he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, Luke</hi> 4.18, 19. Which is true, not onely in reſpect of thoſe that are bruiſed and broken in heart with godly ſorrow for ſin, but alſo in reſpect of ſuch whoſe hearts and minds are bruiſed and battered with fears and terrours, in reference to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to which they ſtand expoſed for ſin.</p>
               <p>And it is further conſiderable to our purpoſe, that thoſe which our Saviour invites to come to him, and promiſeth them <hi>reſt</hi> if they do, are ſuch as <hi>labour and are heavy laden;</hi> that <hi>labour under, and are laden</hi> with anxious thoughts and cares about their future ſtate; for they are a weariſom burden to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96825:27"/>mind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. And again, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 7.37. and <hi>let him that is athirſt come, Rev.</hi> 22.17. to wit, ſuch as lack and long for ſome cooling and refreſhing to their minds and ſpirits which are heated and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with anxious thoughts and cares about the condition of their ſouls for the future, when they ſhall leave the body. For this Invitation is made to ſuch as were not yet come to Chriſt, had not yet truly believed in him: For a true belief in him quencheth this kind of thirſt. And therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>he that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt, John</hi> 6.35. And again, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water which I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, John</hi> 4.14. This water when once well drunk of, quencheth that flame which before burnt up the ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Again, to ſhew what preparation of mind is neceſſary to make us prize Chriſt when offered, and willing to be governed by him in order to our cure and eaſe, conſider that ſaying of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96825:28"/>our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. <hi>The Whole need not the Phyſician, but the Sick;</hi> to wit, ſuch as are <hi>ill at eaſe in their own minds,</hi> for that is the meaning of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, I conceive. Other than ſuch have not a ſenſe of their need of a Phyſician, nor will care to be governed by his Methods of Phyſick. Which was the reaſon why our Saviour choſe rather to be among Publicans and Sinners than Phariſees: for thoſe being more ſenſible of their obnoxiouſneſs to Gods diſpleaſure than the Phariſees were, who <hi>truſted in themſelves that they were righteous,</hi> were better prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel than the Phariſees were. Which appears by that ſaying of Chriſt to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of Heaven before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the teaching of the Father by impreſſions of natural Religion upon the mind, prepares men for a belief in Chriſt, and a receiving his Goſpel, as they come thereby to be convinced of their guiltineſs, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96825:28"/>of their obnoxiouſneſs to the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God thereby, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in their own minds about their future ſtate after death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am now in the ſecond place to ſhew how the teaching of the Father by natural Religion prepares Men for a belief of the Goſpel, as they come thereby to a ſenſible diſcerning of the nature and tendency of moral righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and goodneſs. Men are taught by natural Religion, that it is a thing good in it ſelf, and well becoming them to adore and worſhip God the author of their Being, and to ſeek unto him in all their needs; to be juſt and faithful, and kind one to another. And they know and find by experience that when they moſt obſerve to do ſo, they have moſt eaſe in their own minds. Their Conſciences never trouble them for any thing of this nature: theſe things when they do them, do not make them afraid of God, as things of a contrary nature do. Such as theſe are things about which mens <hi>thoughts do excuſe</hi> them, as the Apoſtles phraſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96825:29"/>is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. And men find a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between excuſing and accuſing thoughts. Theſe do not draw men before the Judgment Seat of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Day does come, as accuſing thoughts do.</p>
               <p>Now the ſtronger ſenſe men have of the excellent nature of moral righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and goodneſs, and of its peaceable and comfortable effects upon the mind, the better prepared they muſt needs be to put on the yoke of Chriſt, and to ſubmit to his government and precepts of life; becauſe thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of his, are almoſt, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>all</hi> of them of <hi>a moral nature.</hi> The things which he enjoins his Diſciples, are generally good in themſelves, and rather to be choſen than their contrary, in caſe there were no other reward at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them, but onely their ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to humane nature. The minds of men are better appaid and ſatisfied in doing thoſe things which Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, whether they know he enjoins them or no, than they would or can be in doing the contrary. To do to all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96825:29"/>men as we would they ſhould do to us under like circumſtances, brings more ſatisfaction to the mind than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Humility brings more eaſe to the mind than Pride; and ſo does Love than Envy and Malice: and ſo does Meekneſs than Wrath and Rage; and ſo does Mercy than Cruelty, and ſo do moderate deſires to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of this life, than thoſe which are exceſſive. And Temperance and Chaſtity contribute more to the eaſe and health of the body than Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of all which is, That the more men are by powerful impreſſions of natural Religion upon the mind, made ſenſible of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of moral righteouſneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of the peaceable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effects of the practice of it, the ſooner and the more eaſily they will be induced to embrace the doctrine of our Saviour, which in reference to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, conſiſteth moſtly of matters of that nature.</p>
               <p>For we muſt know that here the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96825:30"/>matter ſticks moſt with men. They are well enough content to hear of Chriſts having expiated ſin by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his death, and that forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is preached in his name. But to men that are wedded to their ſeveral Luſts of immorality, the Precepts of Chriſt which are quite contrary to thoſe Luſts, are to them ſo many <hi>hard ſayings,</hi> and they ſay within themſelves, Who can hear them?</p>
               <p>But by how much men are taught by natural Religion to diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Morality and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, both in the nature and effects of them, as to the peace of the mind on the one hand, and to the diſquiet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on the other, as to the honour of their nature and name on the one hand, and to the ſhame thereof on the other; as to the eaſe and health of their bodies on the one hand, and to the contrary on the other; by ſo much are they in a fit preparation of mind to receive the Laws of Chriſt, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join morality with promiſe of great reward, but prohibit and condemn all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96825:30"/>immorality under the ſevereſt penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>The condition on which the pardon of fin and eternal life were promiſed through Chriſt, conſiſts moſtly in a ſincere performance of moral duties towards God and men: it conſiſteth of ſuch a Faith as worketh by love to God and men; which love is an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical fulfilling of the Moral Law, as we are taught, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. From which it ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that by how much men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in morality by the teaching of God, by ſo much is their belief of the doctrine of Chriſt, and the fulfilling of his great and precious promiſes faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe his rules and precepts of living, agree with thoſe ſentiments and notions of righteouſneſs and goodneſs, which are planted in the nature of man; and therefore the conſent of their minds to them as juſt, reaſonable, and good, and fit to be obſerved, muſt needs be the more eaſily obtained. And not onely
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96825:31"/>ſo, but by means of this congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Precepts of Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> and the notions of moral righteouſneſs <hi>within</hi> us, planted in the nature of man, way is made alſo to gain belief of the other doctrines of Chriſt, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly upon ſupernatural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ſuch as are his being the Son of God, and the forgiveneſs of ſin, and the like. For when they find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in his doctrine preſſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating upon the minds of men ſuch precepts of moral righteouſneſs and goodneſs, as they by their own natural light know to be good, and therefore from God, but never any thing to the contrary, they will be the more eaſily induced to believe him to be no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, but one ſent from God, as he affirmed he was, and conſequently to believe all his other doctrines.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the manner how Almighty God doth raiſe ſuch a ſenſe in men of the true nature and effects of moral righteouſneſs and goodneſs, as by which they are prepared to believe the Goſpel, I do not think he doth it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96825:31"/>onely by aſſiſting their faculties to act according to their natural liberty, for ſo he does aſſiſt them when they abuſe their liberty in acting ſinfully: but God does it by ingaging their minds more to conſider their ways than they had done before; to conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency of thoſe good ways which they had refuſed to walk in, and the like concerning thoſe evil ways which they had choſen. And by a frequent repreſentation of theſe things to their thoughts, and by drawing their minds to look more narrowly into them, they come better to diſcern the nature and tendency both of the one and of the other, and ſo to make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgment of them. And by that means their former averſation from that which is good, and ſtrong and violent inclination to that which is evil, comes to be weakned and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing broken. And this prepares them to be quite overcome by the powerful motives of the Goſpel, when they come to be conſidered, and to be turned quite about. This we ſee in <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:96825:32"/>for an inſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways and I turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi> And again, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.28. <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions which he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> In theſe Scriptures we ſee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration takes place firſt with men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turn, and by that means they are brought to turn: that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon conſideration of ones ways, is turning from tranſgreſſion and to Gods teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Now God can and does when he pleaſeth, pitch mens minds and thoughts upon ſuch things as he would have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, and in ſome ſort terminate and hold them to them. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> knew this when he prayed thus unto God: <hi>Keep this for ever in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the thoughts of the hearts of thy People, and prepare their heart unto thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18.</p>
               <p>To exemplifie this whole matter of Gods preparing men for the belief of the Goſpel; let it be conſidered how it came to paſs that thoſe few uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96825:32"/>Proſelytes from among the multitude of thoſe of the Nations of the Gentiles, at firſt came to be ſuch. How came ſuch as the <hi>Aethiopian Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> to be ſuch devout perſons as they and other ſuch Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes are deſcribed to be, when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of thoſe Nations remained ſtill in groſs Gentiliſm? Doubtleſs it came to paſs by the awakening of their minds by God, to conſider things more than their Neighbours did, to conſider the nature and tendency of morality and immorality, and what was like to be the iſſue of both at laſt, in reſpect of rewards and puniſhments in another World. And the innate light and reaſon of their minds would dictate to them, that Vice could not poſſibly tend to their happineſs, nor Vertue to their infelicity in the next World. And this made them, before they were Proſelytes, ſo far as the light of nature aſſiſted by God did lead them, to chuſe to do what was moſt likely to end in happineſs, and to avoid what was moſt likely to make them miſerable at laſt. This no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96825:33"/>doubt made them betake themſelves to the worſhip of the true God onely, when others of their Neighbours did not; and in this to join with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though not entirely in the ſame Inſtitutions of Worſhip, becauſe they were not given them in command as they were to the <hi>Jews.</hi> This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and other of their Country-men, did firſt ſpring, as I ſay from their taking important things more into conſideration than others did. And by this they came to be prepared to receive the Goſpel, ſo that they fell in with it readily when it was preached unto them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the firſt hearing. Thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes we read of <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. were ſuch as were ordered and diſpoſed in their own minds towards eternal life, to wit, to look after it, and to be thoughtful about it; and as many as were ſo, did as we there ſee, believe.</p>
               <p>Such as theſe Proſelytes, were thoſe <hi>other ſheep</hi> (I doubt not) of which our Saviour ſpake, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. which as he ſaid, <hi>are not of this fold, them alſo I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96825:33"/>muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice.</hi> They were made tractable afore-hand, ready to follow the Shepherd when they ſhould hear his voice. Such alſo we may well ſuppoſe the good Ground hearers to be, who were of good and <hi>honeſt hearts,</hi> as they are deſcribed, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. of honeſt minds, not willing to repreſent things to themſelves better than they are, nor to put a cheat upon themſelves and their own ſouls, by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them into a better opinion of themſelves, and of their good condition Godward than there is cauſe. Like him of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Who flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful, Pſal.</hi> 36.2. They are not of ſuch partial and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt minds as to be thoughtful and careful about the outward Man, and things of this preſent World, and to be altogether regardleſs and careleſs of their ſouls the better part, and of the concerns for Eternity, nor treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to betray them.</p>
               <p>Thus far to ſhew how God hath prepared men for the belief of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96825:34"/>Goſpel, onely by making principles and notions of natural religion opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in them by a powerful impreſſion of them upon their minds.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>How God by adding Revealed Religion to that which is Natural, prepared the Jews for the performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Promiſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN times under the Law, and before the appearance of Chriſt in the World, Almighty God prepared the People of the Jews for the Faith in Chriſt, by adding Revealed Religion to that which is Natural, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which was Natural, more powerful and operative to ſuch an end, by that which was revealed.</p>
               <p>After the Original Law which is implanted in the Nature of all men, became much blurred and defaced in the minds of men, a fair Copy of it was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96825:34"/>delivered to that People by God, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in two Tables of Stone. And this was done, as for other ends, ſo for this, to wit, to awaken in them a greater ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, and their lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs thereby to the wrath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and to condemnation. <hi>The Law worketh wrath,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4.15. that is, it maketh the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of it the more puniſhable, and expoſeth him the more to wrath. <hi>For the ſtrength of ſin is the Law,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith in another place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. it is that which armeth thoſe actions againſt a man, which would not have been puniſhable if there had been no Law againſt them. <hi>For where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> as he ſaith in the former Text. And where there is no tranſgreſſion, there can be no puniſhment due. And by parity of reaſon, where the Law is more obſcure and leſs diſcernable, the tranſgreſſion of it muſt be the leſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable: and the more manifeſt and expreſs the Law is, by which men are left without all excuſe of ignorance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96825:35"/>touching the evil prohibited, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more criminal muſt the offence needs be, as when committed againſt a Law promulgate and fully known. This is that which ſtops the mouths of men againſt all excuſe and plea of ignorance, and lays them naked and open to the penalty of the Law. <hi>What the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth might be ſtopt, and all the World found guilty before God, or ſubject to his judgment, Rom.</hi> 3.19. And as the offence againſt the Law is aggravated and enhanſed, by how much the more the Law is known to be expreſly againſt it, by ſo much may the puniſhment be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be increaſed by that means. <hi>He that knew his Maſters will and yet did it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> above what he ſhall ſuffer, whoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of knowing his duty hath been leſs.</p>
               <p>Now this was the caſe with the Jews: they were under the natural Law before it was promulgated to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96825:35"/>them, as well as all other Nations. But that Law of Nature was grown ſo blurr'd and illegible through the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and degeneracy of men, that they could hardly diſcern that to be ſin in many caſes, which was ſin by the Law of Nature. As for inſtance, <hi>I had not known Luſt to be ſin,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, unleſs the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> They could hardly diſcern inward concupiſcence in this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be ſin, unleſs it brake out into open act. But now by the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the natural Law, this came to be known to be ſin, which indeed was ſo before, but not ſo certainly known to be ſo; and the like in other caſes. But when this and other things were by a promulgate Law more clearly known to be ſin, it was then at their greater peril, if they fell into them: and conſequently they muſt needs be the more apprehenſive of their danger, and their fear the greater in caſe they did. S. <hi>Paul</hi> perſonating a Jew both before and after the promulgation of the Law, ſaith, <hi>I once was alive without the Law,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96825:36"/>but when the commandment came, then ſin revived, and I died.</hi> He did not know himſelf to be in ſo ill a caſe, as the Law when it came diſcovered him to be. And therefore he ſaith again, that <hi>ſin taking occaſion by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deceived him, and by it ſlew him, Rom.</hi> 7. By all this we may underſtand what S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant, when he ſaid, <hi>that the Law entered, that the offence might abound, Rom.</hi> 5.20. that is, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the evil nature and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects of it, might be more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly known, and men made more ſenſible of their ſad condition by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it: and that for this reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, that grace might ſo much the more abound in the ſight of men, when the way and means of eſcaping that condition ſhould be made known to them. <hi>Where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound.</hi> This ſtate of theirs under the Law, was that ſtate of the <hi>ſpirit of bondage to fear,</hi> whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96825:36"/>
               <p>But then this prepared the way of the Goſpel, by making that which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to remove thoſe fears the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. To you that <hi>fear</hi> my name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with <hi>healing</hi> in his wings, ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking of his ſending Chriſt among them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. he came with <hi>healing</hi> to thoſe ſouls which had been <hi>bruiſed</hi> and made <hi>ſore</hi> before by fears and terrours that did ariſe in their minds out of that darker ſtate of the Church, wherein the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, was more obſcurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, by the promiſe they had of the Meſſiah, and by the types and ſhadows of him in the Law, and by the many predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets concerning him, the Lord prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them for the reception of him when he was come. <hi>The Law</hi> in theſe reſpects, was <hi>a Schoolmaſter to bring them to Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:96825:37"/>
               <p>The many precepts of moral righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and goodneſs alſo wherein they were inſtructed out of the Law and the Prophets, prepared them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to receive Chriſt for the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah when he was come indeed, for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of that harmony and good agreement that was between our Saviours precepts of living, and what they had been taught before, both by natural light, and by revealed Religion ſuperadded to it. By this former teaching of the Father, ſome of them became ſuch Sheep as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid his Father had given him, <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 29. It was by vertue of this preparatory teaching of the Father that they knew the Shepherds voice when they heard it. By this they could diſtinguiſh between the voice of the true Shepherd or Meſſias, and the voice of Strangers, the voice of hirelings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the doctrine of our Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with that way of righteouſneſs which they had learned by the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father, as none others did that were but pretenders. It was this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96825:37"/>that made ſuch of them as had heard and learned of the Father, to come to Chriſt, to follow this Shepherd when they heard his voice, that is, to become his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>And yet more particularly, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was ſent by the Almighty Father, to prepare them by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry for their reception of Chriſt, and believing in him. It was foretold by the Angel before his birth, that he ſhould <hi>make ready a People prepared for the Lord, Luke</hi> 1.17. and by a ſpirit of Prophecy at his birth, that <hi>he ſhould go before the face of the Lord to prepare his way, Verſ.</hi> 76. which he did by two things eſpecially; by awakening them to repentance, and by giving them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the near approach and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Meſſiah. <hi>He came into all the Countrey about Jordan, preaching the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, Luke</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p>The People of the Jews were in great part become ſuch a <hi>generation</hi> as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96825:38"/>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, that <hi>were pure in their own eyes, and yet not waſhed from their filthineſs, Prov.</hi> 30.12. ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the Ritual part of the Law, but very immoral in their temper and in their lives: full of a ſelf-choſen righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>their fear towards God, taught by the precepts of men,</hi> to wit, the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition their Elders. They were not ſenſible of the badneſs of their ſtate, their obnoxiouſneſs to the wrath of God, nor of their need of repentance in amending their lives. And under theſe circumſtances a Chriſt that ſhould come to ſave them from their ſins, was not like to be very welcom unto them, nor to anſwer their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation who looked to be ſaved from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke by the Meſſiah, but not from their ſins.</p>
               <p>Now that our Saviour might not loſe the end of his coming amongſt them, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was ſent before him to convince them of their bad condition, of their guilt of ſin before God, and of their liableneſs to his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96825:38"/>wrath. That whereas thitherto the judgments upon their Nation, even the worſt that had befallen them, had been but like the lopping of branches from off the trees that would grow again. But now the Axe was laid to the root of the trees, to cut them quite down, never to grow again; that the utter ruine of their State, Nation, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was not far off, if not prevented. And that nothing could prevent it but confeſſion of ſin, and <hi>bringing forth fruit meet for repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this raiſed a ſpirit of fear in them of the wrath of Almighty God which hung over them for their ſins; which made ſuch multitudes to come to his Baptiſm, to confeſs their ſins, and by his Baptiſm to liſt themſelves as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents. And by this teaching of the Father, they were the better prepared to receive Chriſt when he came, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when pointing to him, he told them, <hi>this is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the World,</hi> that ſin of theirs which expoſed them to ſuch
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96825:39"/>danger, and that put them in ſuch fear as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And who were the Ring leaders in oppoſing Chriſt when he was come, but the Phariſees, Lawyers, and Scribes, ſuch as rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, and would not be baptized of <hi>John?</hi> They were ſuch as were never prepared by a ſenſe of their ſin, and of the danger they were in thereby, <hi>but truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi> They were ſuch as thought themſelves ſo whole as to need no ſuch ſoul-phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician as Chriſt. They did not believe as the Publicans and Harlots did, that they were in any ſuch danger by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin as <hi>John</hi> told them they were; and that was the reaſon why they kept themſelves out of the Kingdom of God, whileſt the others entered in, as our Saviour told them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31, 32. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi> And he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it in the next words; <hi>For John
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96825:39"/>came to you in the way of righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not; but the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and the Harlots believed him.</hi> Thoſe who did believe <hi>John,</hi> and were awakened with a ſenſe of their danger becauſe of ſin, they crouded, as it were, into the Kingdom of God while that impreſſion laſted. <hi>From the days of John the Baptiſt until now, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12.</p>
               <p>If enquiry be here made, that ſince ſome of the Jews in our Saviours time, were by the Fathers teaching in thoſe ſeveral ways before mentioned, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as that they followed Chriſt the good Shepherd when they heard his voice, and ſo became his Diſciples. Then how came it to paſs that all of them did not do the like, who had the ſame means of learning and of being prepared?</p>
               <p>To ſatisfie us in this enquiry, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the firſt place to take notice
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96825:40"/>that there is a great difference between God the Fathers teaching of men, and their learning of him: he teaches all, when yet but few learn of him. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, every man that hath <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> of the Father, cometh unto me, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. Not every one that hath heard him, but every man that hath heard him ſo, as to learn of him, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving inſtruction from him in a way of preparation. For theſe are two things, and the one alas, too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found without the other. <hi>Though I taught them riſing up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkned to receive inſtruction,</hi> ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32, 33. there is a Teaching without a Learning.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why they did not learn when they had the ſame teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as others had; and ſo the reaſon why it was not afterwards given to them, as it was to the Diſciples of Chriſt, to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, is given by our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96825:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>Becauſe they ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they underſtand. This peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing; and they have cloſed their eyes; leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> Which words ſignifie their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, and more than a bare refuſing of that aſſiſtance which God for ſome time vouchſafed them to prepare them for that farther grace and mercy which comes by Jeſus Chriſt: they ſignifie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and ſtriving againſt their being helped and healed, their endeavouring to throw off, and to defend themſelves againſt the means uſed by God to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, and to bring them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things in order to their cure and amendment of manners. <hi>When God called they refuſed, when he ſtretched out his hands to them they regarded not, they ſet at nought all his counſel, and deſpiſed all his reproof, and hated knowledge,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſeth the ill carriage of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96825:41"/>ſuch as would not in the leaſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, or wrought upon by ſuch applications as God made to them, with promiſe of further aſſiſtance of his Spirit and his Word if they would. <hi>Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Prov.</hi> 1.23, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour by the foreſaid words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. does not, I conceive, ſo much intend to ſet forth the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ill carriage of the Unbelieving Jews in not entertaining the Goſpel, as their obſtinacy and untractableneſs under Gods former applications to them in a lower way of teaching, than that of the Goſpel. For their carriage ſignified by thoſe words of our Saviour, is alledged by him as the reaſon why it was not given to them to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, as it was to his Diſciples. For they had oppoſed and withſtood thoſe lower beginnings of God with them, by which he would have prepared
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96825:41"/>them for higher vouchſafements. And accordingly our Saviour applies that ſaying to their caſe, <hi>Whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God had been repreſenting to them by his Prophets, and by the Miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, beſides his ſecret operations upon their minds, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were in by reaſon of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, notwithſtanding their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Church-priviledges, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their numerous Sacrifices, and other ceremonial obſervances. But they laboured to ſilence the clamour of their conſciences, when God had any whit awakened them, and to lay their ſouls aſleep, and to perſuade themſelves there was no ſuch danger did attend them, ſince they were a People with whom God had entered into Covenant to be their God, that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, to whom God had ſaid, I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed. Though they were proud and covetous, unjuſt,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96825:42"/>unfaithful, cruel, envious, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, <hi>Yet they leaned upon the Lord, ſaying, Is not the Lord among us? None evil can come upon us,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.11.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, the reaſon appears plainly why all the Jews, who at firſt enjoyed much-what the ſame means, the ſame aſſiſtance from God to prepare them for a belief of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet were not prepared for it as others of them were. They refuſed, nay they reſiſted Gods firſt aſſiſting grace, whereby he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them to receive farther aſſiſtance from him. And when men do ſo, and continue to do ſo, God after ſome time of ſtriving with them, ſuſpends that application which he formerly made to their minds to prepare them for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance. After which, though they may ſee the Works of God, and hear his Word, and be found in the uſe of ſome external acts of Religion for faſhion ſake, and to do as others do, yet then they do not perceive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96825:42"/>or conſider to any good effect upon themſelves, the end and deſign of them, and ſo are not one jot the better for them, but rather more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and ſenſleſs, which the Scripture calls Gods <hi>hardening or blinding</hi> of men. Not that I ſuppoſe the holy and good God infuſeth any malignant or obſtinate quality into their minds or wills; for <hi>God does not tempt any man to evil, James</hi> 1.13. but his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of them, is either his <hi>with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> by which his Spirit did ſtrive with them to make them better, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. or permitting the evil Spirit more freely to tempt them, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which is their growing worſe and worſe. And thus he dealt with ſuch like untractable and obſtinate Jews in Ages long before the coming of our Saviour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>My People would not hearken to my voice, Iſrael would none of me. So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts;</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them as ſometime he had done. And again, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the neceſſity of thoſe effects on the mind, which God ſometimes works by Principles of Natural Religion, to prepare all thoſe for the performance of the condition of the promiſe, which do at all perform it.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFter all this which hath paſt, you will ſay perhaps, What does all this diſcourſe concern us, who live after Chriſt is come, or any who call themſelves Chriſtians, and which do own Chriſt to be the true Meſſiah and Savior of the World? The Jews indeed they were prepared for their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt againſt he ſhould come, by principles of natural and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Religion, and ſome of the Gentiles by principles of natural Religion onely. But how can this concern us Chriſtians
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96825:43"/>who have prevented the need of any ſuch preparation for receiving Chriſt, by having received him already, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been taught by our Parents from our Childhood to do ſo, when they taught us all the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith?</p>
               <p>Yet we who live now after Chriſt is come, are as much concerned to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a ſaving reception of Chriſt, by the <hi>ſame temper of mind,</hi> as they were who lived before his coming. Our Saviour hath ſaid it, <hi>That no man can come to me, except it be given unto him of my Father, John</hi> 6.65. And again, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him, ver.</hi> 44. And if this be true with reſpect to all men, then of us who live in theſe days, as well as of thoſe who lived when Chriſt firſt appeared in the World. For our Saviours words, we ſee, contain an univerſal propoſition; No man to whom it is not given of my Father; No man whom the Father which hath ſent me draweth not, can
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96825:44"/>come unto me. He does no more limit his aſſertion to thoſe who did precede, than to thoſe who do ſucceed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but a ſenſe of our obnoxiouſneſs to the diſpleaſure of God, and the ſad effects of it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, upon the account of ſin, is as neceſſary now as ever it was, to prepare and diſpoſe men heartily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt: becauſe it is by this ſenſe on our minds, that Chriſt is looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the moſt <hi>ſuitable good,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as the moſt deſireable good, as I ſhewed before. It is by means of this ſenſe when any thing ſtrong and affecting, that Chriſt becomes precious unto men, as he is to every one that believes. <hi>To you that believe he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. A true ſenſe of the danger we are in, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provoked the great God againſt us, gives great diſquietneſs to the mind, until we come to know that that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure is taken off, and the danger we were in thereby removed. And it is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96825:44"/>the ſenſe of this danger that makes Chriſt precious to us, when we come to underſtand that we cannot eſcape this danger but by him; and when we find that pain removed by believing in him, which the ſenſe of danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put us to.</p>
               <p>And it is this ſenſe that prepares the ſoul to receive Chriſt as Lord as well as Saviour, by that time the Goſpel is well opened to men. And the reaſon is, becauſe they underſtand thereby, that none can have the benefit of that Atonement and ſatisfaction made by his death, but ſuch as are content to be governed by him in their lives, and to yield obedience to his precepts: that none can be ſaved by him, that refuſe to become ſincere Diſciples to him. And they will find it no unreaſonable thing for them to obey his Precepts and to imitate his Example, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that to do ſo, is in effect but to abandon thoſe ſins which created ſo much trouble in their mind before, by making them liable to and by putting
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96825:45"/>them in fear of the eternal wrath of Almighty God. The ſenſe of that danger their ſins had expoſed them to, and of that anxiety of mind they were brought into thereby, will prepare the mind and diſpoſe the will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt as Lord, and to obey him in forſaking thoſe ſins, ſo long as they are well aſſured, that then and not till then they ſhall be pardoned through his bloud, and ſo be diſcharged from thoſe fears of the wrath of God which had given them ſuch uneaſineſs of mind before.</p>
               <p>And when they have found the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the eaſe of mind and peace in the Spirit which they have by their knowledge of Chriſt ſo long as they obey him; and the ſad thoughts, dark and doubtful apprehenſions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings of mind and ſtorms in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which ſin had wrought and raiſed in the ſoul before, it will then make them out of love with ſin, and afraid to have any more to do with it.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96825:45"/>
               <p>And thus you ſee according to the reaſon and nature of the thing, how uſeful and neceſſary ſuch a ſenſe is, as I have oft mentioned, to prepare and diſpoſe men to go to, or to receive Chriſt, when he is made known to them by the Goſpel, and that as well now under the Goſpel, as before; if by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt we underſtand ſuch a receiving as is ſaving. But otherwiſe men may, and doubtleſs do, without any ſuch ſenſe as is effectual to its end, not onely profeſs belief in Chriſt, but alſo really believe in him with an ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative, ineffectual and dead Faith.</p>
               <p>And to the end we may yet farther ſee how neceſſary ſuch a <hi>ſenſe</hi> in men of their danger, as I have been ſpeaking of is, <hi>to prepare and diſpoſe</hi> them to come to Chriſt in good earneſt, and to believe in him with all their heart, I ſhall ſhew it you by the method which our Saviour and his Apoſtles uſed in their preaching. Both he and they inſiſted mainly in the firſt place in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to mens converſion, upon ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96825:46"/>as tended to beget in them <hi>a great ſenſe of their danger by reaſon of guilt upon them.</hi> And this they did by preaching Repentance; by which as I ſhall preſently ſhew, they laboured to beget ſuch a <hi>ſenſe</hi> in men.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour began his Preaching with this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.17. <hi>From that time Jeſus began to preach and to ſay, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And ſo did his twelve Apoſtles when he ſent them out by two and two: <hi>They went out and preached that men ſhould repent,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Mark</hi> 6.12. When the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> gives a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the firſt Principles or beginning Doctrines of Chriſt, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> from Dead Works is not onely one of them, but is the <hi>firſt of all in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Heb.</hi> 6.1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> both of the method and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his preaching publickly and from houſe to houſe, when he told them that he had teſtified both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks, <hi>repentance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96825:46"/>towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Firſt Repentance, then Faith: Repentance for ſin, and from ſin; and then Remiſſion of it through faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now in thus preaching Repentance in the <hi>firſt place</hi> they laboured to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs men with a ſtrong ſenſe of <hi>the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were in until they did repent.</hi> For that was the great Argument or motive by which they perſuaded them to it. <hi>We knowing the terrour of the Lord, we perſuade men,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Thus our Saviour taught the People, that ſo long as they did not repent and reform, though it ſhould coſt them the cutting off their right hand, and plucknig out their right eye to do it, <hi>they were in danger of being caſt into Hell, where their Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched, Mark</hi> 9.43. <hi>That they were condemned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that the wrath of God did abide on them, ſo long as they continued in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, John</hi> 3.18, 36. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached Repentance at <hi>Athens,</hi> his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96825:47"/>argument to perſuade to it was, <hi>becauſe God hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the World in righteouſneſs, Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. And no greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be uſed to awaken mens fears, and to haſten them out of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſtate, than to ſet before them the terrour of that day, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are in every hour of falling under it, ſo long as they remain unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The conſideration of which, while the impreſſion was upon him, made <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour on the Bench <hi>to tremble,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> at the Bar reaſoned of righteouſneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and <hi>the judgment to come, Acts</hi> 24.25.</p>
               <p>And generally mens Repentance takes its <hi>firſt riſe</hi> from their <hi>fears</hi> of falling under the wrath of Almighty God. Which doth very well accord with what was ſaid by <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and twice by <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Proverbs: <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom, Pſal.</hi> 111.10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. and 9.10. The beginning of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96825:47"/>Wiſdom, that is, of becoming truly wiſe, as men are when they become truly religious, and never till then. And this uſually <hi>begins</hi> as I ſay, in thoſe <hi>fears</hi> which are raiſed in men, out of a ſenſe of their obnoxiouſneſs to the wrath and diſpleaſure of God for ſin paſt. And from thence indeed it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to a fear of diſpleaſing him any farther for time to come, in hope of obtaining pardon for what is paſt: and this is wiſdom indeed (<hi>there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Pſal.</hi> 130.4.) But <hi>fear</hi> in this latter ſenſe, hath its <hi>riſe</hi> and beginning from fear in the former.</p>
               <p>The principle of Self-preſervation, which is deeply rooted in every mans nature, does naturally cauſe a fear of God, as armed with Almighty power to deſtroy them that have provoked him. But in mans degenerate ſtate, we cannot ſay it is ſo natural to fear diſpleaſing him, nor is attained to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome hope of pardon for what is paſt. Fear in the former ſenſe goes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96825:48"/>before fear in the latter, as the needle does before the thred. It hath indeed as godly ſorrow hath, a tendency in it to work Repentance, though neither of them amount to ſaving repentance it ſelf. Fear of wrath <hi>hath torment</hi> in it, and that prepares a man to hearken to that which will give him eaſe, to wit, the doctrine of pardon through Chriſt, and to the doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as the condition of obtaining it. As rain and moiſture are to the ground on which Weeds or Thorns grow, to prepare the way of tearing them up by the root, ſo is the fear of Gods wrath to make way for the plucking up mens luſts by the root: it makes the heart more ſoft and tender. For by how much ſin hath diſquieted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the mind with fears of the wrath of God (provided it be not to exceſs, as in caſe of deſpair) by ſo much the leſs grievous it will be to part with it, in hope of obtaining both eaſe and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thereby.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96825:48"/>
               <p>But here to prevent all miſ uſe of this Doctrine touching the neceſſity of a ſenſe in each ſinner of his obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſneſs to the wrath of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for ſuch a Repentance, Faith, and Obedience as is ſaving; let this be obſerved and remembred by way of caution, to wit, That no greater a ſenſe hereof is neceſſary to this end, than that which iſſues and ends in ſuch a Repentance, Faith, and Obedience. We muſt not meaſure the truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Repentance, Faith, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the meaſure or degree of the ſenſe we have of our liableneſs to Gods wrath, or our fears of it; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the dueneſs or ſufficiency of ſuch a ſenſe to prepare us, by the truth and ſincerity of our Repentance, Faith, and Obedience. It is not unlikely but that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> might have a greater ſenſe of their obnoxiouſneſs to the wrath and diſpleaſure of God, than moſt of thoſe who through a due ſenſe of their liableneſs to wrath, have been prepared for a ſaving Repentance, Faith, and Obedience: but yet we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96825:49"/>cannot judge by that, that they had any ſuch Repentance or Faith.</p>
               <p>So much ſenſe therefore of mens danger by reaſon of their guilt of ſin is ſufficient, be it more or leſs, as does prevail with them ſincerely to repent of ſin paſt, to receive Chriſt Jeſus as Saviour, Lord, and Governour for time to come, to ſave them from ſin by his death and to be governed by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and example for all times to come, whether peaceful and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or however adverſe or hazardous they may be. And the reaſon why ſuch a ſenſe is ſufficient, be it more or leſs, is becauſe it reacheth its end, it hath done its work for which it was raiſed by God, when once it hath thus drawn men to Chriſt to become his true Diſciples, to believe in him, and to learn of him the Chriſtian life. All means whatſoever are ſufficient in their kind, when they attain their end for which they were appointed, and ſo this of which we now ſpeak. This is a truth ſeen by its own light.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:96825:49"/>
               <p>By this the great miſtake of ſome good people appears, who have been afraid to apply Chriſt unto themſelves as a Saviour, and to lay hold of the gracious promiſes of the Goſpel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in doubt with themſelves, whether they had been ſufficiently humbled, broken, and prepared by legal terrors; when yet they have been zealouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and induſtrious to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him in a good life. When once men are made willing to receive Chriſt as Lord and Saviour, and to walk in him as they have received him, there is no place left to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their humiliation hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or no. For our Saviours <hi>invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of coming to him, is made to him that is <hi>athirſt,</hi> and his promiſe to him that does come in good earneſt, is, that he will <hi>by no means caſt him out.</hi> The promiſe of being received if they do come to Chriſt, is not made upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of being thus or thus humbled, but upon condition of their coming to him. Nor does any degree of that humiliation which conſiſteth in fear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96825:50"/>or terror, avail any man further than it is an occaſion of his applying himſelf to the remedy prepared by God againſt his danger.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid to ſhew what ſenſe of ones ſpiritual danger is ſufficient in its kind, and for the end for which it ſerves, it may appear alſo, That ſuch perſons as have by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a pious education, drunk in operative principles of godlineſs in the early days of their lives, ſo that like <hi>Ohadiah</hi> they have <hi>feared God from their youth;</hi> or as <hi>Timothy, have known the holy Scriptures from a child,</hi> need not be in doubt of their own good eſtate Godward, though they have not found in themſelves ſo tormenting a ſenſe of their ſpiritual danger as ſome others have done, to prepare and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to repent and believe the Goſpel, if they can but find and feel in themſelves Repentance and Faith in the true nature and genuine effects of them. No man need much to be concerned about the nature of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96825:50"/>means, as whether it be proportionate to the end, after he once ſees the end effected in himſelf. His ſenſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſufficient, which cauſeth him to fly in due time to the place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
               <p>There needs a greater ſenſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and more affecting fears, to make one willing to part with thoſe ſins and evil ways he hath been long accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to, and hath had a ſtrong affection for, than there is to make another wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forego thoſe evils he never had much to do with, nor much affection for. An ordinary blaſt may throw down a Plant before it hath taken rooting, when no leſs than a great tempeſt and ſtrong blaſt will tear up a Tree of long ſtanding and deep roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>Yet I muſt ſay, that the greater ſenſe men have of the greatneſs of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were in, and the more that ſenſe hath afflicted their ſoul with fear and grief, by ſo much the more they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96825:51"/>are likely to value and prize, to love and honour that Saviour by whom they find themſelves delivered from it. Hence it is that ſuch as have been grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinners than others before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, have many times proved more eminent Saints than others after; fuller of love to Chriſt, and zeal for him. Thus it was with <hi>Mary Magdalen, who loved much becauſe much was forgiven her,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid. Whereas, as he obſerves likewiſe, that he to whom <hi>but little is forgiven, the ſame loveth but little, Luke</hi> 27.47.</p>
               <p>And thus I have diſpatched the firſt of the two things I propoſed to inſiſt on, and to explain, to wit, what is done by God by way of preparation to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the minds of men to perform the condition of the promiſe. I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond, which is to ſhew what is done by God to aſſiſt men in the actual performance of that condition on which pardon of ſin and eternal life are promiſed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:96825:51"/>
               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>How by the very Nature of the Goſpel, God does aſſiſt men in performing the condition of the Promiſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN ſhewing what God does in aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting men in the performance of the condition of the promiſe of Pardon and Life, two things will come under conſideration;</p>
               <p n="1">I. What aſſiſtance is given by God, by his very giving us the Goſpel to this end; and</p>
               <p n="2">II. What by the influence and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That men are <hi>aſſiſted</hi> by the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> in their performing the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life, is very evident. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>That he had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96825:52"/>begotten the Chriſtian Corinthians through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. And S. <hi>James, that God of his own will begat the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by the word of truth, Jam.</hi> 1.18. And S. <hi>Peter, that they were born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing men to be prepared by ſuch teaching of God the Father, as hath been before deſcribed, the Goſpel it ſelf is of ſuch a <hi>nature</hi> as makes it very apt to attract and draw ſuch men to the belief of it, and obedience to it, when attended to, in which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth conſiſt: and this in a double reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In reſpect of the ſubject matter of it, or things contained in it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In reſpect of the evidence by which it is confirmed to be from God and undoubtedly true.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:96825:52"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the ſubject matter of it, or things contained in it.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; it contains a Declaration, who, and what an one <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son of God and Saviour of the World, and what he hath ſuffered to make atonement for the ſin of the World, and to obtain reconciliation between God and men, after their rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And the Goſpel as ſuch, cannot but facilitate its own way into the minds of ſuch men as are burdened and pained with the ſenſe of their own guilt, and liableneſs to Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It being ſuited to their caſe, and contrived on purpoſe to give to ſuch eaſe and relief, it cannot but render it ſelf acceptable to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. It is indeed a ſaying, a doctrine worthy of accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if any thing is ſo which the World ever knew, yea worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the higheſt degree. And its
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96825:53"/>being ſo, makes ſinners which are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their very great need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the more ready and willing to believe it, and to hearken to any thing that tends to ſtrengthen their belief of it. We have a ſaying which is found true upon common obſervation, That men are willing to believe that to be true, which they would fain have to prove ſo, and are inquiſitive after the evidence of its truth, that they may confidently believe it, and rejoice in it. I have ſhewed before with what joy the Goſpel was entertained at its firſt going forth into the World, by ſuch as were to any conſiderable degree made ſenſible of the danger they were in by reaſon of ſin, and therefore I do not need to enlarge upon it farther here.</p>
               <p>Again, the Goſpel contains great and precious promiſes of pardon of ſin and eternal life, upon condition of Repentance, Faith, and new Obedience, and moſt dreadful threatnings againſt ſuch as reject thoſe terms. Now the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96825:53"/>Goſpel in theſe reſpects, is of a perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive nature, and hath an aptneſs and fitneſs in it to prevail with men to uſe their endeavours of performing the condition of eſcaping the damnation of Hell, and of obtaining the glory of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the terrible threatnings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch as continue unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their lives, when theſe fall into minds already diſquieted with fears for what is paſt, are very apt to alienate mens minds from ſin, and ſo to help on the performance of that part of the condition of the promiſe, which conſiſteth in Repentance or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. The ſtronger ſenſe men have of their danger by reaſon of ſin formerly committed, and alſo of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into greater danger, if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſin, after pardon is offered upon condition of amendment, the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily will they be perſuaded and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to accept of the condition of pardon, and to put forth their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perform it. The ſenſe of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96825:54"/>danger which divine threatnings do awake in men when any thing ſtrong, will cauſe them to enquire how they may eſcape it, to the end they may ſpeedily fall upon the uſe of ſuch means by which ſuch an eſcape may be obtained.</p>
               <p>Thus thoſe <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> Acts 2. <hi>cried out, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> And the Goaler when once in a trembling poſture, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Acts</hi> 16.30. Theſe affectionate enquiries cauſed by a ſenſe of their danger, argued their willingneſs to do any thing they could to eſcape it; of which they gave proof by ſetting immediately, and without any delay, upon what they were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to do to that end.</p>
               <p>This ſenſe of danger awakened by divine threatnings, ſo long as it laſteth, will take off that pleaſure which men before were wont to find in ways of ſin and wickedneſs, and make the taſte of them bitter, and by that means
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96825:54"/>eſtrange their minds from them. What is it that makes men at any time to fall out with their ſins and turn them off, but an awakened ſenſe in themſelves, by which thy feel they have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by them into the ſnare of death, into ſuch danger as that the very ſenſe and fear of it, quite ſwallows up that pleaſure which they were wont to take in thoſe ſins. And under theſe circumſtances, it will be a matter of far leſs difficulty for men to perform the condition of the promiſe, ſo far as that ſtands in forſaking of ſin, than it would be to continue in it. For in this caſe they find the fear and trouble which ſtill is at the heels of ſin, is far greater than any pleaſure they can then find in it. <hi>In vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 1.17. Even ſo, while men have their eye upon the preſent fear and future danger ſin expoſeth them to, it diſarms the temptation to it of its power, and renders it too weak to prevail with them to run themſelves into the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of preſent fears, and into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96825:55"/>deſtruction for the future. A Dog will forbear his otherwiſe deſired mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, while his eye is upon the Cudgel which is held over him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the promiſe through Chriſt of ſuch ineſtimable benefits as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, and the eternal glory of Heaven are, upon condition as of Faith, ſo of ſincere Obedience, hath a great tendency in it to reconcile our minds to our duty in particular acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It is inſeparable from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men to deſire the happineſs of their own Being, in the general notion of it, and for perpetuity alſo. And the more deſirable any object is, and the more there is in it to make our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs great, the more powerfully are we drawn thereby to comply with the condition, and to uſe the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, when we hope it to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. The greater and more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive the object of deſire is, by ſo much will the difficulty of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and means of obtaining it, ſeem the leſs. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſerving ſeven years
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96825:55"/>for <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſeemed to him but a few days, for the love wherewith he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her.</p>
               <p>All which ſhews that the immenſe greatneſs of the benefits promis'd in the Goſpel, does tend greatly to reconcile our minds to the condition of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, notwithſtanding ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent difficulties do attend it. Juſt as we ſee in other things: Men would not cark and care, moil and toil as they do, nor undertake ſuch weariſom jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and hazardous voyages as men commonly do, were it not that the benefit they expect to obtain thereby, does reconcile their minds to theſe difficulties. What enabled <hi>Moſes</hi> to forſake the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the honours of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and to unite himſelf with an oppreſſed People, when he could not otherwiſe avoid ſin and ſerve his God as he had a mind to do? Why, it was the <hi>eye,</hi> the <hi>reſpect</hi> he had therein <hi>unto the recompence of the reward, Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. The hope of the recompence of reward, made the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96825:56"/>difficulties of Gods ſervice, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt, and ſuffering with the People of God, more eligible and deſirable than the pleaſures of ſin, which were but for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Hope of benefit we ſee then is a great and powerful principle of action in men: and if the promiſe of the great things of the Goſpel does but affect, ſtir up and quicken our hope, this will be enough to put thoſe endeavours into motion, by which the condition of obtaining them will be performed. <hi>It is by the exceeding great and precious promiſes of the Goſpel that men are made partakers of a divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do affect their hope; this hope changeth the thoughts and purpoſes of men, in order to the obtaining of the things promiſed and hoped for; by all which they become new men, reſtored to the image of God which had been loſt by ſin, which is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:96825:56"/>
               <p>The difficult part of performing the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life, lies in mens forſaking the ſins to which they had been accuſtomed, and in practiſing the contrary Vertues from which they have been eſtranged. But the Goſpel we ſee enables men to do both by working upon their fears and hopes. For when two ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful principles of action concur and conſpire together to promote the ſame end, to produce the ſame effect, as they do in this, though in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the operation muſt needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, powerful, and prevalent, and the work like to go on with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Fear and hope are the two han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of the Soul, by which it is taken hold of and drawn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having thus ſhewed, how apt and fit the Goſpel is in reſpect of the ſubject matter of it, to draw men to ſuch a belief of it, and obedience to it, as in which the performance of the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life doth conſiſt: I am now to ſhew in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96825:57"/>the next place its farther aptitude this way, in reſpect of that evidence it hath of its Divinity, Truth, and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>For indeed all the power it hath to work upon mens fears and hopes by its menaces and promiſes, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of their effects in mens lives and actions, depends wholly upon the ſuppoſition of its truth and certainty. Men would not be moved neither by the threatnings nor promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, how great ſoever they be, did they believe the Goſpel to be but fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. And therefore the All-wiſe God hath as much concerned himſelf to give ſufficient atteſtation to the truth of the Goſpel, as he hath, to acquaint men with the things reported in it.</p>
               <p>To this end the Almighty Father hath by a <hi>voice from Heaven</hi> teſtified that Jeſus Chriſt is his beloved Son, and that his doctrine is to be attended to, as to one whom he had ſent into the World to declare his whole mind
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96825:57"/>touching mens ſalvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. and 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe alſo ſerved thoſe numerous <hi>miracles</hi> which he wrought. For theſe were <hi>ſigns</hi> to aſſure us that he was what he affirmed himſelf to be, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son of God, and conſequently that his doctrine is of divine authority. <hi>Many other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book. But theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name, John</hi> 29.30, 31.</p>
               <p>Theſe miracles in conjunction with the nature of our Saviours doctrine in nothing contrary to natural Religion, had certainly a very great tendency in them to beget a belief in him and of his doctrine, or elſe he would never have marvelled as he did at the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe which ſaw them and heard him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.6. <hi>He marvelled at their unbelief.</hi> Their unbelief under ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96825:58"/>circumſtances, is mentioned again as matter of wonder, <hi>John</hi> 12.37. <hi>But though he had done ſo many miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, yet they believed not on him.</hi> But this would have been no matter of marvel to our Saviour, or wonder to his Diſciples, if there had not been a mighty power in thoſe miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virce men and to perſuade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. To this end alſo ſerved the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt from the dead: for by that he was <hi>mightily declared to be the Son of God, Rom.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>And when the Apoſtles of our Lord were after his Reſurrection ſent forth to convert the World to Chriſtianity by preaching the Goſpel to them; as a means to make it efficacious to this end, and to procure it credit and authority in the minds of men, they were endued by the Lord with a power of working miracles, and of ſpeaking with new tongues, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. <hi>They went forth and preached every where, the Lord work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and confirming the word with ſigns following,</hi> Heb. 2.4. <hi>God alſo
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96825:58"/>bearing them witneſs both with ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was in reſpect of theſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confirmations of the Goſpel, I doubt not, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays his <hi>preaching was in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power,</hi> and not with enticing or perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible words of mans wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. It was by reaſon of this kind of demonſtration of the Goſpel to be from God, which was made by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operation of the Spirit by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that the Goſpel was received as the Word of God, and not as the Word of Man; as all thoſe Diſcourſes of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were, which had no other confirmation, than what the Wit and Oratory of men could derive from principles of natural and humane Wiſdom. But the Apoſtles doctrine, as it was in the nature of it above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane pitch to find out, ſo their way of confirming of it was above all humane power and wiſdom alſo. As their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96825:59"/>doctrine was known onely by the Holy Spirits revealing, ſo the arguments, motives, and reaſons by which they perſuaded men to believe it to be from God, were fetched from the Spirits own mighty operations, which were viſible to men, as well thoſe that did not, as thoſe which did believe. <hi>They compared and ſuited ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, ver.</hi> 13. The nature of their arguments by which they perſuaded men to believe their doctrine, were ſuited to the nature of their doctrine; both being from the Holy Spirit. The one by the Spirits revelation <hi>to the Apoſtles,</hi> the other by the Spirits mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operations <hi>by the Apoſtles.</hi> They proved their doctrine was revealed to them by God, by the teſtimony which he gave, that he had ſent them to preach what they did preach, by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to do ſuch things which none could do but by virtue of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, which put forth it ſelf in them. God (as was ſaid) did bear them witneſs by ſigns, wonders, and by divers miracles which he enabled them to do and to ſhew.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:96825:59"/>
               <p>And being the Goſpel was upon the account of this confirmation, received as the Word of God, and not of Man, as the Author of it; therefore it was that it did operate ſo powerfully as it did in the hearts and lives of them that received it, to the transforming them in their minds and ſpirits, and in the tenour of their lives and actions, into other manner of men than they were before. By reaſon of which transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Scripture ſtiles them New Creatures, and the man thus altered, the New Man. <hi>When ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, ye received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel then thus confirmed, as hath been repreſented, was and is ſo glorious an object of Faith, and ſo every way ſitted and prepared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand mens belief of it, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth it impoſſible but that men ſhould believe it, unleſs the Devil
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96825:60"/>hath ſtrangely blinded their minds. And therefore he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: in whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we ſee what great aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance God hath vouchſafed us for our performing the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by giving us his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Lord by his Prophet, ſpeaking of how much he had done for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old, to enable them to be what he expected they ſhould be, in order to the happineſs he deſigned them, ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it?</hi> that is, What in reaſon could they expect he ſhould have done more to make them become obedient and fruitful, than he had done? And yet he hath done much more for us who live under the Goſpel than he did for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96825:60"/>them. For he hath ſent his own Son to reconcile us to himſelf, and himſelf to us by his death. He hath ſent his own Son to perſuade men, which is more than all the Prophets which he ſent before. And as he is greater him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo he perſuades by greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the Prophets were wont to do, both in reſpect of what hath been done for us already to oblige us, and in reſpect of what he will do, in rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if obedient, and in puniſhing if diſobedient. And all this lies fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Goſpel, by which life and immortality is brought to light; and which comes to us more gloriouſly atteſted alſo, than the doctrine of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets did to them. And therefore the Lord may much more appeal to us than he did to them, and ſay, What could have been done more to engage you to believe and obey the Goſpel, and ſo to perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe, which I have not done? And if ſo, <hi>How then ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96825:61"/>Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?</hi> And yet behold he hath done and does more for us in another reſpect under the Goſpel, than he did in times paſt for his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People. For according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious predictions of the Prophets of old, we under the Goſpel have a more plentiful effuſion of the Spirit to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to perform the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life, than ever they ordinarily had. Which brings me to the ſecond thing I propoſed to inſiſt on, which is, to ſhew what aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance men receive in performing the condition of the promiſe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and operation of the Spirit of God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>How by the Holy Spirits operation upon the Mind and Will, men are aſſiſted in performing the condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt before I proceed to ſhew this, to prevent miſunderſtanding in this matter, I muſt premiſe thus much by way of caution, to wit, That when I propoſe the influence and operation of the Holy Spirit to be conſidered as an <hi>aid</hi> diſtinct from that which is vouchſafed by the Goſpel it ſelf, I would not be underſtood thereby to deny that aſſiſtance which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Goſpel it ſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition of the promiſe, to be the <hi>aid and aſſiſtance of the Spirit,</hi> at leaſt in ſome reſpect. I onely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there is an influence and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit upon the hearts of men by which they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform the condition of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96825:62"/>promiſe, <hi>over and above</hi> what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in its own nature abſtractedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, does contribute thereunto. Otherwiſe, as I have been now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the operations of the Goſpel it ſelf is of, and from the Holy Spirit, both in reſpect of its revelation and conſirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that what is ſaid and done by the Goſpel, is in a ſenſe ſaid and done by the Holy Spirit. And they are led by the Spirt, and walk in the Spirit, that make the Goſpel their Guide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>and holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And the things ſpoken by the Prophets in the Old-Teſtament, are ſaid in the New to be ſpoken by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. and 28.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. and 10.15. And it's ſeven times ſaid in <hi>Revel. c.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. <hi>He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſaid to them in and by thoſe Epiſtles which S. <hi>John</hi> ſent to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96825:62"/>ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi> And God is ſaid to have <hi>teſtified againſt the People of the Jews by his Spirit in his Prophets, Neh.</hi> 9.30. And S. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid to thoſe in his time for oppoſing the Goſpel; <hi>Ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your Fathers did, ſo do ye.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid touching ſuch as ſhould deſpiſe their doctrine and commands, <hi>He that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, deſpiſeth not man, but God, who alſo hath given unto us his Holy Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 48. By all this it appears, that what is done by the doctrine of men divinely inſpired, is done by the Spirit of God; and what is done againſt it, or againſt them for the ſake of it, is done againſt the Spirit of God. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me;</hi> ſaith our Saviour alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p>But yet though the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Goſpel in performing the condition of the promiſe, be the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Spirit, yet it is <hi>not all the aſſiſtance</hi> they receive from the Holy Spirit therein. For when the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96825:63"/>holy Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>the Goſpels coming unto men, not in word onely, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. of their being <hi>born of the Spirit, John</hi> 1.13. and 3.5. <hi>of the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. <hi>of their obeying the truth through the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. <hi>of a being built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 2.22. <hi>of the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and of Gods working in them to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. and the like, there is no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the ſenſe of ſuch ſayings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>alone</hi> operation of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, as having God or the Spirit of God for its Author, and no more. The Prayers which our Saviour made and taught his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples to make for the ſucceſs of the Goſpel, and which the Apoſtles made and taught the Chriſtians to make for the like; do all of them imply like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſomething more to be done by God for the renewing of men unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than onely by his bare ſending his Goſpel among them.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:96825:63"/>
               <p>Although men can conſider matters diſcovered by the Goſpel when they hear them, as well as they can any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ſet forth by Diſcourſes of another nature; (and indeed God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects they ſhould do ſo, at the peril of their own deſtruction, if they do not) yet ſuch is the zeal of the Lord to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and ſet forward the buſineſs of our ſalvation, that he is <hi>not willing to truſt the work onely in our hands,</hi> though he hath brought it to our hands by ſuch preparations wherein he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all endeavours of ours. <hi>He doth not onely bring the Goſpel and our minds together, and then leave them to operate upon each other in the ſtrength of their own nature onely;</hi> but is graciouſly pleaſed to accompany his word more or leſs, as he ſees good, with a ſecret operation of his ſpirit upon our minds, both to incline and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> the internal faculties to exerciſe and imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about matters of this high nature, and likewiſe to <hi>aſſiſt them in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:96825:64"/>
               <p>There is doubtleſs a ſecret power and efficacy of the divine Spirit goes along with the Goſpel into the mind and will, by means whereof the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel does the more readily and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually work upon the mind and will, to the renewing of them. When the Diſciples ſcattered by occaſion of the Perſecution by <hi>Saul,</hi> preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The hand of the Lord was with them, and that a great number believed and turned to the Lord, Acts</hi> 11.21. Their believing and turning to the Lord, was the effect of the Lords hand being with them in preaching, as well as it was the effect of what was preached. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 1.16. Believing and Salvation are the effects of Gods power going along with the Goſpel, as well as of the Goſpel it ſelf. By that the Goſpel becomes more quick and powerful, and ſharper than a two-edged ſword. <hi>It is the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> as it is called, as well in reſpect of its being managed by the Spirit, as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96825:64"/>it is by being provided by the Spirit for Chriſtians to manage. The whole ſucceſs of the Goſpel in producing thoſe happy effects in men, by which they become other manner of men than they were before, is aſcribed unto the grace and bleſſing of God that goes along with the Goſpel. <hi>I have planted and Apollos watered, but God gave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. Upon this account all that appearance of the Vertues of Chriſt which is in true Chriſtians, by which they give ſome good account unto the World what an one Chriſt is, and what manner of thing his Goſpel is, is aſcribed unto the operation of his holy Spirit upon their hearts, in that metaphorical way, uſed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he told the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth, That they were the Epiſtle of Chriſt written by the Spirit of the living God, upon the fleſhly Tables of their hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:96825:65"/>
               <p>Thus much in general to ſhew that there is an aſſiſtance by the operation of Gods Spirit vouchſafed unto men in performing the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>over and beſides</hi> what aſſiſtance they receive therein from the nature of the Goſpel. I ſhall now proceed to ſhew a little more particularly how men are aſſiſted by the operation and influence of the Holy Spirit in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life. Not to undertake to deſcribe all thoſe ways by which God communicates his <hi>aids</hi> unto men in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition of the promiſe, but onely ſo much of thoſe divine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as may give ſome light in the thing, and ſome ſatisfaction to our minds touching this great affair of our ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One of the firſt things is a procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from men, or Gods working in them <hi>a fixedneſs of thoughts</hi> upon the things which concern their ſalvation or damnation, a keeping their minds upon them. Before this is done, men
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96825:65"/>may have many <hi>fluctuating</hi> thoughts about God and Chriſt, Heaven and Hell, and about the way of eſcaping the one, and of obtaining the other, and yet be little or nothing the better for them. For theſe being things out of ſight, and remote from the ſenſes, there are a multitude of other thoughts which throng into the mind, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects that lie open to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſcatter and divide, yea, and which in a great meaſure exclude and thruſt out of the mind, thoſe other more neceſſary thoughts. The thoughts and cares about the <hi>Farm,</hi> the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> the <hi>Oxen,</hi> and the <hi>marrying of a Wife,</hi> ſpoken of in the Parable; yea, and worſe than theſe, about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful pleaſures and undue ſeeking of honours; theſe ſo entertain and take up mens minds, that thoughts of God and another World, and the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Religion, which have not the advantage of making their way into the mind by the ſenſes, have little or no room there. Hence comes the ſin of forgetting God, ſo much ſpoken of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96825:66"/>in Scripture, which carries in it a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting our accountableneſs to him, and conſequently a forgetfulneſs of all thoſe things which depend upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding of theſe.</p>
               <p>Now while thoughts of this nature rule and bear ſway in the mind, and other thoughts are onely now and then floating there without any ſetled abode, theſe latter can have no power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence to alter the ſtanding tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the mind, or to change the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations of the will, which yet are neceſſary to the performing of the condition of the Promiſe. And therefore one of the firſt things, as I ſay, which God does in aſſiſting men in the performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe, is to ſtay and ſix their thoughts upon the things which concern their ſalvation. Though their thoughts are and muſt be exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of this preſent life; yet their thoughts about their ſouls and another World, are ſo fixed by God in their minds, when thus aſſiſted by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96825:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>him, that they are continually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling themſelves with their other thoughts, and correcting their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, and exerciſing a power over them. Here now they dwell; though they muſt give ſome place to other neceſſary thoughts, yet ſo as that they are never long abſent, but ſtill return into the mind. Thus the good Ground hearers which bring forth fruit with patience, are ſaid to be ſuch as having heard the Word, <hi>keep it, (Luke</hi> 8.15.) that is, they keep it on their minds, ſo as that it is not ſtolen out of their hearts by the evil one, by filling the mind with other things, as it befals the Stony ground hearers: nor choaked, or ſtifled in its operation by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering multitude of other thoughts about things grateful to the fleſh, as about riches and pleaſures, and luſts of other things, as it is in the Thorny ground hearers. Not as if where God thus ſixeth the thoughts upon their principal objects, that there he gives memories to retain all they hear, that is not meant by their <hi>keeping</hi> the word,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96825:67"/>but that ſuch keep upon their minds the ſcope and ſubſtance of thoſe points of the Chriſtian Religion as are neceſſary to their ſalvation, as the fruit of all their Hearing. It is the <hi>ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Word which is able to ſave the ſoul, Jam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>

                     </gap>.</hi> 21. that is, as it is ingrafted upon the mind by ſetled thoughts and ſixed conſideration, without which men may hear all the days of their life, and yet be but as the <hi>ſilly women</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>laden with ſins, and led away with divers luſts,</hi> who were <hi>always lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and never able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6, 7. The Lord made <hi>David</hi> wiſe through his Word, but it was by keeping it and his mind together. Thou, ſaith he, through thy commandments, haſt made me wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than mine enemies: <hi>for they are ever with me.</hi> I have more underſtanding than all my Teachers: <hi>for thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are my meditation, Pſal.</hi> 119.98, 99. Thus when the Lord aſſiſted <hi>Lydia</hi> in the buſineſs of her believing, <hi>he opened her heart ſo that ſhe attended to the things which were ſpoken by Paul. She held
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96825:67"/>her ſelf to them;</hi> ſo the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors render it: ſhe kept her mind ſtaid upon them by ſerious conſideration. And this we ſee was the effect of Gods operation upon her mind; he opened her heart ſo that ſheattended, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. It is God that thus <hi>puts his Law into mens minds,</hi> that pitcheth and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth their thoughts upon the things contained in it, according to the tenour of the New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. This is one thing wherein the Divine Aſſiſtance doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing is, the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits operation upon the mind, enabling it by the light of the Goſpel, to <hi>diſcern the nature, tendency, and uſefulneſs of the things diſcovered and revealed by the Goſpel.</hi> By mans Apoſtaſie from God, and cuſtomary ſinning, the mind is darkened, the eye of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding corrupted, and thereby to a great degree rendred impotent, and unable to diſcern things diſcovered by the Goſpel to be what they are, though ſet before it. Like the man in the Goſpel,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96825:68"/>who while imperfectly cured of his blindneſs, ſaw men walking as Trees: they have and can have in that ſtate but confuſed and indiſtinct notions of ſpiritual things: <hi>if the eye be evil, the whole body is full of darkneſs.</hi> This being mans caſe, there is need of a Divine Power to work ſome cure upon the Eye of the mind to diſcern aright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things of the Goſpel. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had ſome ſenſe of this upon his mind when he prayed thus unto God: <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous things of thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119.18. The Diſciples had not right notions of things revealed by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning Chriſt, until our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour opened their underſtandings to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scriptures, Luke</hi> 24.45. When the Veil is taken away, ſo that men <hi>with open face behold the glorious things of the Lord in the Goſpel, it is by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. Though <hi>the hope of the Chriſtians calling, and the riches of the glory of Gods inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Saints</hi> are revealed in the Goſpel, yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew for all that,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96825:68"/>that there was need of <hi>having the eyes of the underſtanding inlightned, to know and diſcern what thoſe are;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed unto the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for it, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Epheſians, c.</hi> 1.17, 18. And if theſe Chriſtians after they believed, ſtood in need to have the eyes of their underſtanding further enlightned by God, in order to a more clear and full proſpect of the gloriouſneſs of the Hope ſet before them, for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and encouraging them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere and hold out in their obedience to the Goſpel, then doubtleſs they much more ſtood in need of ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning by God in this kind to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them at firſt to begin to be ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient.</p>
               <p>In the dark men are apt to miſtake one thing for another; ſo before this illumination of the mind by the Spirit of God, they are apt to call evil good, and good evil; to put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter; to chuſe evil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of good, and to refuſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96825:69"/>good under the notion of evil. But when the light of the Law and Goſpel are let into the mind, by which every thing is diſcovered and diſcerned in its true ſhape and colour, then Sin and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue appear to be what they are in their own nature, ſin to be ſin indeed, and vertue and goodneſs to be vertue and goodneſs indeed. Then ſin appears in the turpitude, deformity and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of its nature, and in its tendency to the ruine of the ſubject in which it dwells: and righteouſneſs, vertue, and goodneſs appear in their beauty and uſefulneſs, and in their tendency to the happineſs of ſuch in whom they dwell. For inſtance; Before this illumination, men are apt to miſtake the doctrine of the grace of God which brings ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to think they ſhall be ſaved becauſe Chriſt died for ſinners, and becauſe they believe he did ſo; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be but now and then troubled in their minds, and ſorry for their ſins, and do pray God to pardon them, though they ſtill continue in them. But when the eyes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96825:69"/>are opened to ſee things as they are, and are repreſented in the Goſpel; then they perceive none ſhall be ſaved by the death of Chriſt, what ever their belief may be, but ſuch as ſhall be perſuaded by the great motives of the Goſpel, to be reconciled to God by being reconciled to their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, throwing down the weapons of their rebellion, and becoming univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ſincerely obedient to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Laws of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This illumination of the mind by God, contributes ſo much towards mens performing the condition of the promiſe, that the whole of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is ſometimes meant in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when but this only is mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another part of the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance afforded unto men in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of the promiſe, is the Holy <hi>Spirits operation upon the will</hi> to aſſiſt it in what is proper to it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96825:70"/>of the condition of the promiſe. For what ever ſenſe there is begot in men of the danger they are in by reaſon of ſin: or whatever illumination is wrought in the mind touching the way and method laid down by God of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that danger; yet until the will be changed and wrought to a firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of complying with the terms on which the promiſe of pardon and life through Chriſt is made, the work is not done, the perſon is not regenerate, nor in a regular capacity of enjoying what is conditionally obtained by Chriſt, and conditionally promiſed through him. Men are not begotten of God, nor born of God, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of ſome that are; they are not begotten by the word of truth, nor born again of the immortal ſeed of the Word, until the change be made in the will as well as in the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and when ever it is made, it is the effect of a divine operation. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure, Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:96825:70"/>
               <p>Now in that aſſiſtance which is vouchſafed unto men in renewing them in their wills, in <hi>working in them to will,</hi> ſeveral things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Holy Spirit diſpoſeth the Will to be <hi>paſſive,</hi> in reference to thoſe notices given by the enlightned mind and underſtanding touching thoſe things which have been diſcovered to it, by the Goſpel through the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating operation of the Spirit upon it. The Will having been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to buſie and exerciſe it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other objects, ſuch as the ſenſes have preſented to it, things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern onely this preſent world and life, it will hardly ſuffer any paſſage for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and divine things which are ſtrangers to it, without ſome divine operation of the Spirit to incline the will thereto, or to open a paſſage for them. Which is done (I conceive) by ſuſpending the evil influence which the will had upon the underſtanding, in keeping or with-holding it from conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with any ſeriouſneſs and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96825:71"/>the things that concern the ſoul and another life. And if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be but at liberty ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequently to conſider ſuch things as well as thoſe that concern onely this preſent life, the will then cannot but ſee and taſte them to be better, becauſe the mind and judgment in ſuch caſe, cannot but repreſent them to the will as much better, and as things wherein the happineſs of our nature is much more concerned, than in any, than in all the things of this world.</p>
               <p>God in taking off the will from the foreſaid bad influence it had upon the conſiderative faculty, <hi>takes away the heart of ſtone</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks of. For the heart of ſtone which God ſaid he would take away, ſignifies the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible temper of the will, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance it makes againſt the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings taking thoſe things into ſerious conſideration which tend to perſuade the will to alter its purpoſes, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its choice of objects.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96825:71"/>
               <p>Mens not conſidering things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their ſouls and another life, when yet they can and do conſider things that relate to the animal life, is juſtly imputed to the faultineſs of their wills; they do not conſider them, becauſe they will not, not becauſe they cannot; it is becauſe they have no propenſion of will to engage their conſiderative faculties about thoſe things. <hi>They turn back from God,</hi> and why? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they will not conſider any of his ways, John</hi> 34.27. So that until God do take off this ſtrong Bias which is upon mens will, they will not conſider thoſe things, which if they did ſeriouſly conſider, would certainly change the bent and motion of their wills.</p>
               <p>Now how Almighty God does take off this ſtrong influence which the will hath upon the mind to keep it from conſidering things of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I have ſhewed, at leaſt, in great part in Chap. 1. of this Diſcourſe; to wit, by raiſing in the mind ſuch <hi>ſenſe</hi> of guilt and danger in reference to the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96825:72"/>ſoul, as does counterpoiſe the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which proceed from the will againſt ſuch conſideration. For when the will cannot give eaſe to the mind by putting it upon the conſideration of any thing elſe than thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſoul and a future ſtate, then in reference to the mans own relief, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes content that the mind ſhould ſeek its eaſe, by conſiderations of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature than what it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accuſtomed to. And thus the will becomes at the leaſt paſſive as to thoſe conſiderations and notices which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an awakened and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the wills being made thus paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it comes, together with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to taſte and feel the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſweetneſs of thoſe things whereof the great motives of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are made, the uſefulneſs of them to make a man happy, beyond any thing it ever taſted before. <hi>The ear trieth words, as the mouth taſteth meat,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 34.3. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96825:72"/>ſenſe of the body being put for the internal ſenſe of the mind touching thoſe things that come into it by the ear. The mind by conſidering what a man hears, taſteth whether it be good or bad, as he doth his meat by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Thus the ſuperlative goodneſs of the great things of the Goſpel come to be taſted both by the underſtanding and the will, by a diligent and due conſideration of them, which is the minds chewing them. We read of mens <hi>taſting the heavenly gift,</hi> their <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. of the <hi>taſting that the Lord is gracious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. of holy <hi>Davids</hi> ſaying, that Gods Word was <hi>ſweeter to his taſte than honey to his mouth;</hi> and of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſaying how he <hi>eſteemed it more than his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food;</hi> and of the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs eating of it,</hi> and of his finding it thereupon <hi>the joy, and the rejoicing of his heart.</hi> However theſe, or ſome of theſe ſayings may be meant of a higher degree of this taſte, than men meet with upon the firſt change that is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96825:73"/>made upon their mind and will, yet doubtleſs, ſomething of this ſpiritual relliſh is found upon the mind and will of every true Convert, upon his firſt effectual turning, and does contribute to the forming of thoſe good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are taken hereupon; which brings me to the next thing:</p>
               <p n="3">3. The will by having received ſome taſte of the ſuperlative goodneſs of the great and precious promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel touching pardon of ſin and eternal life, comes thereby to be reconciled to the terms or condition on which thoſe great benefits are promiſed, and to take up a reſolution of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perform thoſe terms or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Though it be a great thing for a man to reſolve upon ſuch a thing as to turn his back upon his formerly beloved vanities, and to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſtudy and practice of other kind of things, from which he hath been willingly and wilfully eſtranged, yet the ſenſe of the danger of refuſing to do ſo, and the hope of the greatneſs
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96825:73"/>of the benefits he ſhall receive if he does, prevails with the will to reſolve upon it againſt all that which would draw it another way, God alſo <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening him</hi> thereunto, <hi>with might by his Spirit in the inner man.</hi> And this he does, at leaſt in great part, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the great motives of the Goſpel preſent to his mind, and by keeping them under his conſideration, and drawing his thoughts frequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which is yet more difficult, and wherein the Divine Aſſiſtance is greatly needful, is to <hi>do</hi> as well as to will, and <hi>to put in execution</hi> thoſe good purpoſes when they have been raiſed and formed in the will. <hi>To will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not, Rom</hi> 7.18. <hi>The Spirit indeed is willing, but the Fleſh is weak, Mat.</hi> 26.41. Such ſayings as theſe ſhew it to be a harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do indeed, than it is to purpoſe to do.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:96825:74"/>
               <p>There are many good purpoſes in men which ſtick in the birth, prove abortive, and never come into act for want of ſtrength in the will [in which they were conceived] to bring them forth. Few are ſo bad but that at ſome times and in ſome good mood they reſolve to amend and become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the Spirit of God is at work on their minds and conſciences to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them: but theſe purpoſes wear off and die within moſt men, and never come to effect for want of ſtrength and firmneſs. Many would be better that yet remain bad, if they could be ſo with wiſhing and deſiring, without reſolving to put themſelves to the trouble of croſſing their own corrupt humour, and of denying the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cravings of the fleſh. And thoſe that do reſolve upon thoſe labours and endeavours which are neceſſary to thorow converſion of ſoul, yet many times find a great ſtrife within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, between the taking up of ſuch reſolutions, and the putting them in execution; they meet with great and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96825:74"/>ſtrong ſolicitations from the fleſh from the ſenſitive appetites, to let fall ſuch reſolutions, and great diſcouragements ſet before them alſo to hedge up the way with thorns. <hi>The Fleſh luſieth againſt the Spirit,</hi> and the Devil aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the Fleſh all he can with his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions: ſo that it becomes a matter of great difficulty for mens purpoſes and reſolutions in this kind, to hold out, and to make their way thorow all this oppoſition. And when ever this difficulty is overcome, and mens reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions become ſo ſtrong as to carry them through all this oppoſition, it is to be attributed to God, it is becauſe God <hi>worketh</hi> in them to <hi>will and to do</hi> of his good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God then we ſee worketh in men to do, by working in them ſtrength of reſolution in willing to do, thereby drawing that out into actual performance which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on. But I do not ſay that the Spirit of God doth enable ſuch mens performance to anſwer their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96825:75"/>to the height preſently, and at the firſt. That which the Spirit of God does enable men at firſt to do in this caſe, is honeſtly, really, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to ſet upon the work reſolved on; that is, ſincerely to endeavour to reform, amend, and to become new men; to ſtrive againſt all known ſin, and to endeavour to do all known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as well as they can; but the victory is got but by degrees.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference between a mans getting the victory over thoſe oppoſitions of Fleſh, World, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which withſtood him in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, when he was ſetting upon the work of amendment of life, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying thoſe enemies of his ſoul ſo as that they ſhall no more annoy him, or endanger his falling ſhort of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs he ſeeks: (which to be ſure they will, notwithſtanding his firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, unleſs he purſue that victory by ſeeking the utter ruine and deſtruction of them, by keeping up a continual war againſt them. The former victory
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96825:75"/>I reckon is perfectly obtained when men are not prevailed upon by any oppoſition whatſoever, but that they will and do ſeriouſly, and ſincerely, and actually engage in a conſcientious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſeveral duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, enjoined by our Saviour both in abſtaining from evil, and in doing good.</p>
               <p>But the latter victory is obtained but by degrees, as the new man grows ſtronger and ſtronger, and the old man weaker and weaker, like the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> A man I conceive does commence ſincere Chriſtian and real Diſciple of Chriſt when he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the firſt victory, but cannot approve himſelf to God and his own conſcience to be and to continue ſuch, farther than he follows his enterprize, and purſues that victory by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>deſtruction of the whole body of ſin,</hi> and by aſpiring after a <hi>ſtanding compleat in all the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:96825:76"/>
               <p>When our Saviour ſaid (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.47, <hi>That ſervant which knew his Lords will and prepared not himſelf, neither did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes:</hi> we ſee the leaſt that will ſecure a man from this threatning of our Lord, is a mans preparing himſelf to do according to his Lords will. And if by preparing himſelf be meant a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf in the beſt poſture he can to do it, by uſing the beſt means and helps he can in order to it, and then doing it as well as he can, though not ſo well as he would; then it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable that for a man thus to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf to do his Lords will, will not onely ſecure him from being beaten as a diſobedient ſervant, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo render him acceptable to his Lord in ſuch his preparation to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>And I think the Apoſtles rule will hold in reference to this, though men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but upon a particular occaſion; that of Almſ-giving, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96825:76"/>according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> So long as a mans doing his Lords will as well as his alms, does but anſwer his ability and capacity, and proceeds from a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind,</hi> a mind inclined and bent to do better, as he to give a better alms if he could; this mans endeavour and ſervice will be no more rejected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo mean, than the poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows two mites were, but be accepted becauſe it holds ſome proportion with his ability, and proceeds from a mind and will, that would have put the man upon doing more if he could have done it. And this indeed is in a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſenſe, a mans ſerving his Lord and Maſter <hi>with all his might,</hi> with all that little ſtrength which he hath.</p>
               <p>And yet in this, Almighty God does not, I conceive, weigh men in reference to their performance or endeavours to perform, by grains and ſcruples. For <hi>he knows whereof we are made, and how we are but duſt,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96825:77"/>He conſiders the compoſition of our nature, Fleſh as well as Spirit, and the conſtitution and complexion thereof, and how the motions and activity of the Spirit are limited and ſtraightned by the body to which it is united. He conſiders all the diſadvantages we are under from without us, as of times and places where the providence of God hath caſt us, and of education, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and acquaintance, and the like; he conſiders all a mans circumſtances, and then according to the goodneſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of his nature, makes allowances in eſtimating a man according to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and performances. He is not extream in marking what is done amiſs. <hi>He pities us as a Father pities his children, and ſpares us as a man ſpares his own Son that ſerves him,</hi> if the Bias of our will and conſtant endeavours do but ſtand right towards him, and if our endeavours do but hold ſome good proportion to that aſſiſtance we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him. An inſtance of all which we have in the character which the Scripture gives of <hi>David,</hi> when it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96825:77"/>ſaith, <hi>He turned not aſide from any thing commanded by God, all his dayes except in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I note by the way, to the end we might be the better able to make ſome judgment not onely of what aſſiſtance men receive from God when he worketh in them both to will and to do, but alſo <hi>what that willing and doing is,</hi> which we may hope will through grace, be accepted for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that condition, to which the promiſe of pardon and life is made.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſeen in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how Almighty God by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his grace, brings about that change both in the mind and manners of men, by which the condition of his promiſe of pardon and life is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. He awakens mens fears by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſenſible of their danger by reaſon of ſin. And theſe <hi>fears,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they grow any thing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96825:78"/>ſtrong, <hi>prevail</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>prejudices</hi> which make men unwilling to conſider the concernments of their ſouls and things relating to another life. And by conſidering, men come through Gods further aſſiſtance to have new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things, to ſee and to judge of things as they are, and then to chuſe or refuſe them according to that judgment.</p>
               <p>God does not give men new facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of underſtanding and will: he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſts thoſe faculties to throw off that burden which oppreſſed them, to break thoſe fetters by which they were bound, and ſo to reſtore them by degrees to their native liberty of acting regularly. Hence the Scripture calls this work of God upon the ſoul, a being <hi>renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him, Col.</hi> 3.10. that is, to a right judgment of things wherein the ſoul of man reſembled its Maker. It is termed <hi>a being renewed in the Spirit of the mind, Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. <hi>a being transformed by the renewing of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96825:78"/>the mind,</hi> Rom. 12.2. <hi>and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5.</p>
               <p>That which is moſt connatural to the will in man, is to chuſe his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is not in mans power to chuſe to be miſerable under that notion, but whenever he does ſo, its under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good. And this is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that cleaves to man in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate, to chuſe that which is evil under the notion of good; and likewiſe to chuſe an inferiour good with a greater degree of <hi>volition</hi> than a good that is ſuperiour. As when a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good, and the good of the body, is choſen with a greater ſtrength and power of willing, than an eternal good, and the good of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now that which God does in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating man, is the vouchſaſing him ſuch <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> as by which his <hi>mind is reſtored</hi> to a power and liberty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>right judgment</hi> of things, to judge that to be good which is ſo, and that to be evil which is ſo. And then to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96825:79"/>make a right judgment between an inferiour and a ſuperiour good, which the Apoſtle calls a <hi>proving or trying things that differ, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of things that are excellent, Phil.</hi> 1.9. That which he does therein in reference to the <hi>will,</hi> is to enable it in its election and rejection of things, to <hi>be governed</hi> by the rectified <hi>judgment of the mind,</hi> to be no longer impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the irregularity of the ſenſitive appetites unto which it had been in bondage, while they uſurped the Throne, the place and office of the underſtanding and judgment in giving laws to the will what it ſhould chuſe and what it ſhould refuſe. For ſo far as the will is renewed, it chuſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes, according to the laws and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of an enlightned mind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified judgment, and no longer by the blind appetites and propenſions of ſenſe. When ever an inferiour and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour good come in competition, the will ſo far as renewed, will ſtill chuſe that which is ſuperiour. And when two evils come in competition, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96825:79"/>and a leſs, the evil of ſinning, and the evil of ſuffering, the will as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed chuſes the leſs.</p>
               <p>But in all this change made in the mind and will, there is <hi>no unnatural force</hi> put upon the faculties, but on the contrary, they are thereby <hi>relieved</hi> againſt an unnatural force which had been put upon them. They had by an unnatural force been turned aſide from acting regularly to the making of wrong judgment of things, and wrong elections of them. It was an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force which put the ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions into the place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the will in her reſolutions and elections. And Gods work in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and renewing the ſoul, is but his relieving and freeing it from theſe tyrannical impoſitions, and reſtoring the faculties in their ſeveral operations to their priſtine liberty and order: the mind to judge of things as they are, and the will to ſubmit her ſelf in her reſolutions and elections, to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the judgment now recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96825:80"/>and the appetites and paſſions to conform themſelves to the elections and reſolutions of the will under the conduct of ſuch a rectified judgment. And when things are thus right in the ſoul, which is the fountain and ſpring of external actions, the life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation cannot in the main and in the general courſe of it, but be regular alſo.</p>
               <p>The doing of all this, the working ſo great a change in the ſoul, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed require not onely the operation of Gods word, but the operation of the hand of his power alſo, to bring every thing into its right place, and each faculty to do its own work. For the faculties of the ſoul, mind, and will, are enfeebled by ſin, which is the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul, as mens limbs are by ſickneſs of the body, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do that which otherwiſe would be natural, eaſie, and pleaſant to them, until God himſelf is pleaſed to convey ſtrength into them, to <hi>ſtrengthen men with ſtrength in their ſouls,</hi> as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeaks.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:96825:80"/>
               <p>Yet it muſt be confeſſed that God does not to effect this cure, give this ſtrength in ſo miraculous a manner as ſtrength and <hi>perfect ſoundneſs</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Cripple, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. which was done in an inſtant, but in a more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely and gradual way; the ſeed which he ſows in the ſoul, comes to perfection by degrees, <hi>firſt the blade, then the ear, after that, the full corn in the ear, Mark</hi> 4. the work of thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converſion is not begun and finiſhed all in an inſtant ordinarily, but is uſually carried on in ſuch a ſlow and regular proceſs, as if it were wholly contrived and wrought by the power of our own reaſon, as a late judicious Author well expreſſeth it.</p>

Of Gods not hindering men from refuſing his aſſiſtance, and of the reaſon why.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is of no ſmall concernment to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our minds in this, to wit, that it is not for want of mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God towards thoſe that periſh, that yet they do periſh. And if we conſider how that God does aſſiſt even thoſe that periſh, towards their performing the condition on which ſalvation is promiſed, until that aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is rejected, and that their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing proceeds from their refuſing to uſe that aſſiſtance, and the reaſon why God does not hinder them by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibleneſs
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96825:81"/>of his grace from refuſing that aſſiſtance, it will go far toward ſuch a ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe, and ſhew that God does aſſiſt thoſe that periſh, towards their performing the condition on which ſalvation is promiſed. This I ſuppoſe will appear more than probable when theſe things following ſhall be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The holy Scriptures acquaint us, that <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. <hi>That he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. Now ſince neither of theſe can be attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods aſſiſtance, how can it be ſaid that he would have <hi>all men</hi> to come to repentance, if he did not afford them his aſſiſtance towards it? How can his willingneſs on this behalf be known or diſcerned, if he ſhould with-hold that aſſiſtance from any of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which that cannot be done,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96825:82"/>which yet he ſays he would have done?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame mercy and grace which inclined God the Father to give his Son, and the Son to give himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom <hi>for all,</hi> cannot as we may well conceive, but incline him to afford unto <hi>all</hi> his <hi>preparatory aſſiſtance</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performing that condition, without which his giving of Chriſt for all, would be ineffectual to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. His giving his Son for all, which is the greater gift, infers his willingneſs to vouchſafe to all the leſs alſo, ſo long as his end in giving the greater will be loſt, unleſs he give the leſſer alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God did not begin to aſſiſt even thoſe that periſh, to perform the condition of the promiſe, until that aſſiſtance has been refuſed and oppoſed, I would fain know how they can be left <hi>without excuſe</hi> when they come to be condemned for not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, unleſs we could ſuppoſe them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96825:82"/>able of themſelves to repent without Divine Aſſiſtance, which yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures will not ſuffer us to ſuppoſe. For if they could as well plead that Divine Aſſiſtance had <hi>never</hi> been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, but <hi>always with-held</hi> from them, as they may plead the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> of their performing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe without Divine Aſſiſtance, it would be an excuſe, why they did not repent and believe, and a great one too.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How can it be ſaid, which yet is uſually and generally affirmed, that under the New Covenant, ſalvation is granted to all men that do not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe it, if aſſiſtance to perform the condition, were not afforded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, as well as the promiſe of it is on that condition; until they wilfully refuſe to make uſe of that aſſiſtance? For men can no more perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which ſalvation is promiſed, without Divine Aſſiſtance, than they can be ſaved without performing that condition: and conſequently Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96825:83"/>cannot be ſaid to be offered to all, unleſs Divine Aſſiſtance be afforded to all likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is no wiſe probable that God ſhould require and expect repentance from <hi>all</hi> men, which yet he does, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. or that he ſhould account them culpable if they do not repent, if he did not afford unto <hi>all,</hi> ſuch means and aſſiſtance as by which they may be able to repent. No wiſe or good man will require ſuch work to be done by his Servants, without furniſhing them with ſuch Tools, without which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done: much leſs will God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire repentance from all men, unleſs he had vouchſafed ſuch aſſiſtance unto all, as by which repentance might be no impoſſible thing to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is no wiſe likely that ſince Chriſt died for all, but that it was that all might have the benefit of his death upon one condition or other: Nor is it any whit more probable that God ſhould promiſe this benefit upon an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96825:83"/>
                  <hi>impoſſible condition.</hi> For men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thing to men upon impoſſible conditions, is but <hi>trifling,</hi> and who dare faſten any thing like it on God? And yet for God to promiſe the benefit of Chriſts death unto all, upon condition of repentance, would be to promiſe it upon an impoſſible condition, unleſs he did afford unto all his aſſiſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the days of the Old World the Spirit of God by the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> by his long ſuffering, and by his operations on mens minds, did <hi>ſtrive</hi> with the then whole World to bring them to repentance, and even with the <hi>ſpirits</hi> which afterward were <hi>in priſon for their diſobedience, Gen.</hi> 6.3. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. which <hi>ſtriving</hi> with them by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> was his <hi>aſſiſting</hi> of them towards their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And if God did afford his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance unto all before the Floud to bring them to repentance, it is no wiſe likely but that he hath done, and does ſo to all likewiſe after the floud.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:96825:84"/>
               <p n="8">8. Our Saviour in his Diſcourſe wherein he ſhewed that no man <hi>could come</hi> to him, except he were <hi>prepared</hi> by the Father, ſaid, <hi>It is written in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and they ſhall be all taught of God, John</hi> 6.45. And it no ways follows that all are not taught of God, becauſe all do not learn, as is ſhewed in another place. Many are taught when but few learn, as many are called when but few are choſen. And if all are taught of God, then all have a preparatory aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We cannot reaſonably think but that God who is the lover of Souls, is more ready to apply himſelf to the minds of all men, to diſpoſe them to what tends to their ſalvation, till by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten oppoſition they provoke him to leave them as incurable, than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil the Evil Spirit is to diſpoſe them to what tends to their deſtruction; and yet this evil Spirit which works in the children of diſobedience, is as we have reaſon to believe, buſie with the minds of all men for their hurt.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:96825:84"/>
               <p n="10">10. When it is ſaid by St. <hi>Stephen</hi> concerning the diſobedient Jews, <hi>Ye have always reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, as your Fathers did, ſo do ye, Acts</hi> 7.51. it is evident that the Holy Ghoſt had been attempting and making many Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays upon their minds, as bad as they were, in order to the reclaiming them; otherwiſe the Holy Ghoſt could not be ſaid to have been reſiſted by them. The Holy Ghoſt doubtleſs did often ſuggeſt to them that the way in which they walked, was <hi>evil in the nature of it, and deſtructive in its tendency,</hi> ſuch as was altogether unſafe for them, and tending to their ruine. For ſo much is ſignified in reference to their Fathers, by that in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.30. <hi>Many years didſt thou forbear them, and teſtifiedſt againſt them by the Spirit in thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Thou teſtifiedſt againſt them, that thou mighteſt bring them again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Law,</hi> as it is in <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. and ſo eſcape the miſery they were otherwiſe bringing upon themſelves. And this the Spirit of God did out of <hi>compaſſion</hi> to them: <hi>He ſent to them by his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96825:85"/>riſing up betimes and ſending; becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15:</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>The goodneſs and long-ſuffering of God,</hi> which he exerciſeth towards the worſt of men, carries in it <hi>the nature of Divine Aſſiſtance</hi> towards their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <hi>It leads to repentance,</hi> according to that of S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2.4. And Gods leading men to repentance, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly his aſſiſting them towards it. By his long ſuffering he gives them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bethink themſelves, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond thoughts to repent; and not onely ſo, but by it he invites them to repent: for that is the language of Gods forbearance, if men would but conſider that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
               <p>For, for what other end can men think that God forbears to cut them off after they have once deſerved it? Surely, it is not that they might ſin the more, and that ſo their puniſhment
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96825:85"/>might be the greater; I believe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any wicked men can think ſo. And if not for that, for what elſe can they think it to be, but that they might have time to repent? But whether they apprehend it and conſider it or no, it is ſo, he ſpares them for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon. <hi>He is long-ſuffering to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. And is it likely that God who ſpares them that they may repent, will deny them his grace, without which he knows they cannot? To what purpoſe ſhould he ſpare them to repent, when he knows they cannot, if he were reſolved not to enable them to it?</p>
               <p>And as the forbearance, ſo the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God <hi>leadeth to repentance.</hi> For when ſinners obnoxious to God, are not onely ſpared by him, but alſo made partakers of the effects of his goodneſs and kindneſs (according to that of our Saviour, <hi>he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil, Luke</hi> 6.35.) they muſt needs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96825:86"/>conclude, if they conſider it, that he does not delight in their miſery as ſuch, though they have deſerved evil and not good at his hands, but that by his kindneſs he would gain upon them and draw them to better thoughts of him, and to a better behaviour towards him. <hi>He left not himſelf without witneſs (viz.</hi> of his ſeeking <hi>to draw all Nations from walking in their own ways) in that he did good, and gave them rain from Heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs, Acts</hi> 14.17.</p>
               <p>If any conclude from Gods forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and goodneſs to wicked men, that he is not diſpleaſed with their evil ways, no more than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are; like thoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.20. <hi>Theſe things thou haſt done, and I kept ſilence,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>thou thoughteſt that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch a one as thy ſelf:</hi> I ſay, if any can perſuade themſelves thus to conclude, it muſt be onely profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wretches, ſinners of no ordinary rank. For very Heathens, and ſuch as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96825:86"/>the Apoſtle brands with a very black character, thought otherwiſe. <hi>Their thoughts did not onely accuſe them, but they knew the judgment of God,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death;</hi> and therefore ſought to appeaſe God by their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. And this is evidence enough, that ſuch as they, as bad as they were, did not think God was not diſpleaſed with their evil ways, or that he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear them upon that account.</p>
               <p>Now this long-ſuffering and this goodneſs of God, is a piece of Divine Aſſiſtance toward repentance, which God vouchſafeth even to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and barbarous Nations. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this aſſiſtance may be much <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> to what is vouchſafed them who have the <hi>Oracles of God</hi> among them; yet this, with the ſecret operation of God by impreſſing principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion upon the minds of ſuch, have, as I have ſhewed, ſo far prevailed upon many of them, as that they have been thereby prepared to receive and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96825:87"/>believe the Goſpel, as ſoon as it hath been ſufficiently revealed and made known to them: and ſo far alſo as in the mean time to become <hi>morally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> in devotion towards God, and in juſtice and charity towards men.</p>
               <p>This ſeems very evident in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed Gentiles, which are ſtiled <hi>Religious Proſelytes,</hi> Act. 13.43. <hi>men fearing God,</hi> ver. 16.26. <hi>devout men,</hi> Act. 10.7. as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his Notes upon <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. Of which ſort were <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch.</hi> And when the Lord ſaid to S. <hi>Paul</hi> in a Viſion at <hi>Corinth, I have much people in this City,</hi> as a reaſon why he would have him continue preaching there, notwithſtanding the Jews in that place oppoſed themſelves and blaſphemed, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.10. I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but he meant it of ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as were in the firſt degree morally religiouſly diſpoſed, and ſo were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive the Faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as other ſuch ſo prepared had done before them. And of ſuch as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96825:87"/>theſe, onely further improved in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, I ſuppoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. when he ſaith, <hi>If the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion keep the righteouſneſs of the law, ſhall not his uncircumciſion be counted for circumciſion?</hi> And in reference to ſuch it was that S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaid, <hi>I perceive of a truth that God is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs, is acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with him,</hi> Acts 10.34, 35.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral conſiderations tend, you ſee, to evince, that God does not deny his preparatory aſſiſtance to any of thoſe that periſh: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their periſhing is not for want of ſo much mercy in God towards them, as by which their periſhing might have been prevented, had they not refuſed and oppoſed the mercy of God it ſelf towards them, in that way and method of ſaving, in which he ſaves others that are ſaved. <hi>God hath concluded all under unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all, Rom.</hi> 11.32. And thoſe who will not be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96825:88"/>ſaved by the mercy of God in that <hi>way and method</hi> of his mercy in which he ſaves thoſe that are ſaved; nor unleſs they can be ſaved by Gods mercy in a way of their <hi>own chuſing,</hi> in oppoſition to Gods, muſt ſit down with their own choice, and go without that ſalvation which they might have had if they would, and which God of his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did more than barely offer them, while his Spirit did ſtrive with them, as it did with them of the Old World. Theſe are they that <hi>receive the grace of God in vain,</hi> againſt whoſe folly S. <hi>Paul</hi> does with great ſeriouſneſs and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs beſeech and admoniſh men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. And truly they are men of a ſtrange preſumption, that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves that which God never promiſed them; as if God ſhould for their ſakes, alter his ordinary method of his mercy in ſaving men, to ſave them, when he hath many and many times peremptorily declared the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the Scriptures of truth. They doubtleſs that can do thus, are the men the Scripture ſpeaks of, <hi>that deſpiſe their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96825:88"/>own ſouls,</hi> that ſet little by them, and concern themſelves little about them.</p>
               <p>By the reaſons given to induce a perſuaſion that God affords his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory aſſiſtance unto all, I do not ſay, nor mean, that he does vouchſafe it to all equally and alike. For the ſcope of our Saviours Parable, I conceive, doth intimate the contrary, when he ſaid, <hi>To one is delivered one talent, to another two, and to another five, Mat.</hi> 25. But then if he which hath but the leaſt, doth but uſe that for the end for which he received it, he ſeems by parity of reaſon to be capable of being dealt with as a faithful ſervant in oppoſition to him who is doomed as ſlothful, though he does not do ſo much as he does who hath received more. He that gained but two talents by uſing the two which he had received, was pronounced a faithful ſervant, and dealt with as ſuch, as well as he who gained five with uſing the five which were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him. So that we ſee a mans faithfulneſs and unfaithfulneſs is eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96825:89"/>by his uſing or not uſing what is afforded him, for the end for which it is vouchſafed him. If he that hath but one talent, gain though it be but one, with uſing that one he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he, we may ſuppoſe, will be dealt with as a faithful ſervant, as well as he that gains two with two, or five with five. If a mans repentance, faith, and uſefulneſs in the World, do but hold ſome good proportion to the meaſure and degree of aſſiſtance he hath from God in means and helps external and internal, though both the one and the other be but of the leſſer ſize, yet we cannot deny ſuch to be capable of better uſage from God than ſuch as are, and will be ſentenced for impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unfaithful, and unprofitable. We cannot ſay that ſo little will make a man which hath more means and helps, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the reward of a faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as will another which hath not ſo much. For <hi>to whom much is given, much will be required, and to whom men commit much, of him they ask the more,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. That
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96825:89"/>probably will not be ſufficient to ſave a man who enjoys the Goſpel, which may be ſufficient to ſave ſuch a one as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was before the Goſpel was made known to him. <hi>God is a God of knowledge and judgment, by him actions are weighed,</hi> and all circumſtances of a mans caſe conſidered. And doubtleſs, God makes larger allowances in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the goodneſs of a mans perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances that hath leſs aſſiſtance, than he doth in eſtimating his for good that hath more.</p>
               <p>This I have here noted the rather, to the end we who have the Goſpel, may have the more charitable opinion concerning the ſtate and condition of ſome of them which have it not: and likewiſe to put them in mind who <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more means,</hi> and therein more aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God than others, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary it is for them to <hi>do more than others,</hi> to the obtaining from God, the approbation of good and ſaithful ſervants, and ſuch as have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition of the promiſe.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:96825:90"/>
               <p n="2">2. Having now made out the firſt of the things propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That God doth aſſiſt even thoſe that periſh, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their performing the condition on which pardon and life are promiſed, until that aſſiſtance is rejected; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to the ſecond. Which is to ſhew that the <hi>reaſon</hi> why men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the pardon and ſalvation purchaſed by our Saviour, is <hi>founded in</hi> their <hi>refuſing to make uſe of Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting grace,</hi> through which otherwiſe they might have been enabled to have performed the condition, on which pardon and life are promiſed.</p>
               <p>Whatever means God uſeth, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to awaken, direct, or perſuade men to repent, reform, and amend, are his <hi>aids</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtances</hi> vouchſafed them to that end. And ſuch are his reproofs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, commands, counſels, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and promiſes, when <hi>applied by his Spirit unto the minds of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, mens <hi>refuſing</hi> to hearken to, and to conſider theſe things, or to comply with them, and their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96825:90"/>not to be affected with them, or moved by them, is their <hi>refuſing to be aſſiſted by God</hi> to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>And upon this very thing is both the wickedneſs of men and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction charged in Scripture, and that under a great variety of expreſſion. Sometimes it is termed a <hi>not enclining the ear to hear,</hi> a <hi>not hearkening,</hi> a <hi>refuſing to hear,</hi> a <hi>refuſing to return,</hi> a <hi>ſtopping the ears that they might not hear,</hi> a <hi>cloſing the eyes that they may not ſee,</hi> a <hi>rejecting of the word of the Lord, and of the counſel of God againſt themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things which are ſpoken of the outward ſenſes, do ſignifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the poſture of bad mens minds, when they refuſe to ſet <hi>their hearts</hi> to what God ſays or does to them. <hi>They ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they hear not,</hi> as our Saviour expreſſeth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13. as men are ſaid to do, when their minds are not at all buſied or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the things they hear or ſee.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96825:91"/>And when it is ſo with them, they are no more moved or affected with the things they ſee or hear, than as if they had not ſeen nor heard them at all.</p>
               <p>And when the Scripture ſaith that they <hi>ſtop their ears that they may not hear,</hi> this ſignifies ſomewhat more, to wit, the <hi>arming</hi> themſelves againſt what is ſaid, ſo that the things ſpoken may not enter their ſouls, nor at all affect them, and is much what the ſame thing which the Scripture means by mens hardening themſelves and ſtiffening their neeks. Theſe are ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to comply with Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to them, for the altering their way and courſe of life, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being affected with or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any thing that may be ſpoken or done to them. <hi>Their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them,</hi> ſaith our Lord concerning them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.15.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:96825:91"/>
               <p>It is true indeed, <hi>No man can come to the Son, except it be given him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and except the Father draw him, John</hi> 6.44, 65. But then the <hi>reaſon</hi> why men are not drawn ſo, as to be <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> to come to the Son ſo ſoon as he is ſufficiently revealed to them, is becauſe they <hi>refuſe</hi> to be ſo. The Wiſdom of God ſpeaks after this manner. <hi>I have called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded, they would none of my counſel, they deſpiſed all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, Prov.</hi> 1.24. God we ſee, calls and ſtretcheth out his hands to ſinners; he reproves, he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and perſuades; <hi>and this is his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But many of thoſe whom he thus draws, they we ſee refuſe, they regard not, they deſpiſe, they turn away: and this is their <hi>refuſing and rejecting Gods aſſiſtance,</hi> it is their refuſing to be drawn; and it is this their refuſing and turning away that <hi>ſlayes them. See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96825:92"/>eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi> Heb. 12.25. <hi>How oft would I have gathered you, and ye would not,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. And again, <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life, John</hi> 5.40.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may perceive by all this, that Gods method of drawing men, is not to work upon them in an <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> manner; for if it were, there would be no place left to draw back or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe: which yet by the Scriptures and experimental obſervation, we ſee there is.</p>
               <p>But this will further appear when we conſider that the ſame preparatory grace and aſſiſtance from God, which will diſpoſe ſome to repentance, proves ineffectual to others, which could not be, if repentance were wrought in an irreſiſtible manner and way. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath told us for inſtance, that if <hi>Tyre and Sidon</hi> had but had the ſame means of repentance vouchſafed unto them, which <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> had,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96825:92"/>they would have repented, when yet <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> did not. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Wo unto thee Corazin, wo unto thee Bethſaida: for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> Nay a leſs degree and proportion of means will work repentance in ſome, when a greater will not in others. Which is an evident proof that repentance may be wrought by a leſs proportion of means than that which is irreſiſtible; otherwiſe that which is irreſiſtible in its operation, may be reſiſted, which is a contradiction in terms. The men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> repented at the preaching of <hi>Jonas,</hi> when the obſtinate Jews did not repent, though they had more powerful means vouchſafed them to bring them to it than the men of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> had, to wit, the preaching and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mighty miracles of our Saviour; which was the reaſon why our Saviour ſaid, the men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould riſe in judgment againſt them, and condemn them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41. <hi>The men of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96825:93"/>ſhall riſe in judgment with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſhall condemn it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold a greater than Jonas is here.</hi> That which is or may be made ineffectual to its end, is not irreſiſtible in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but the means of repentance vouchſafed the unbelieving Jews, was made ineffectual by them as to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though more and greater than the men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> had, by which repentance was wrought in them. By which it is manifeſt that the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Ninevites was not wrought by an irreſiſtible operation; becauſe the means uſed to bring the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews to repentance, was greater than that the Ninevites had, and yet was reſiſted.</p>
               <p>Though I do not ſay or think that God doth always give the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of aſſiſtance to all perſons in like caſes, (he doth what he will with his own) it is enough he gives ſufficient to all; yet the <hi>reaſon of the different event</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> means of grace vouchſafed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96825:93"/>to thoſe that do not repent, and to thoſe that do, ordinarily ſo far as we can judge, lies in the <hi>greater degree of untractableneſs</hi> and unteachableneſs which is found in the one, than is found in the other, by means whereof the ſame applications and aſſiſtances from God, are rendred ineffectual to the one, which are not ſo to the other. But if the method and manner of Gods operation in working repentance and faith, were irreſiſtible, no degree of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy in men, could withſtand it, or render it ineffectual.</p>
               <p>There is an opinion indeed much different from this, and which hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained even among many good and worthy men, which does ſuppoſe the reaſon of the different event of Gods applications to men, to lie in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner of his applying himſelf to them. As when we are invited by it to conceive, that the reaſon why ſome repent and others do not, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God works it <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> in the one, when he refuſes to do ſo in the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96825:94"/>other. The ill conſequents of which opinion we may well ſuppoſe they were no whit aware of who were the firſt promoters of it, and were far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from owning them, though they held faſt the opinion which does infer them. But yet if the things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſequent upon this opinion prove it to be bad, it can be no breach of any rule of charity or modeſty to mention them upon ſo fair an occaſion as this now before us, but rather the contrary if I ſhould not, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt well enough with that veneration I have for the memory of many of thoſe who have embraced it.</p>
               <p>This opinion renders the damnation of ſuch as periſh impoſſible for them ever to have eſcaped after they had once ſinned. For if nothing leſs than Gods <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> operation be ſufficient to bring ſinners to repentance, then would it have been impoſſible for any that periſh to have prevented it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſuch means of repentance was ever vouchſafed them; for if it had,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96825:94"/>they could not but have repented as well as any. This opinion therefore tends to leſſen the grace and mercy of God in that proviſion which he hath made for the redemption of the World, as if it were not ſufficient for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any, but ſuch as are, and ſhall be actually and eventually ſaved. It implies and ſuppoſes that the reaſon why ſuch as periſh are not ſaved by the death of Chriſt as well as others, is for want of ſo much compaſſion in God towards them, as to aſſiſt them to perform the condition on which ſuch ſalvation is purchaſed and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Whereas Almighty God hath not onely given his Son to be a propitiation for the ſin of the whole World, but hath alſo afforded ſuch aſſiſtance unto all, as by which they might have come to perform that condition upon which the promiſe of ſalvation is made, as I have before endeavored to ſhew. It does not conſiſt with the plain and obvious ſenſe of ſuch Scriptures as tell us, that <hi>God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:96825:95"/>For how can we conceive any ſuch willingneſs in God concerning thoſe who yet do periſh, if he ſhould wholly have refuſed them that aſſiſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it was impoſſible they ſhould repent and eſcape periſhing?</p>
               <p>An opinion it ſeems to be, if it were true, which would render all Gods applications to thoſe that periſh, to have prevented their periſhing, uſeleſs and inſignificant. For to what end ſhould other means be uſed to bring thoſe to repentance who in the iſſue do not repent, if no other means be ſufficient to effect it in them, but ſuch an irreſiſtible operation of God as he never intended them? And how ill a repreſentation would it make of God, if he according to the tenor of this opinion, ſhould at laſt condemn men for not repenting, and for not believing and obeying the Goſpel, when it was impoſſible they ſhould, ſo long as God refuſed to work theſe graces irreſiſtibly in them.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:96825:95"/>
               <p>And truly if thoſe that periſh had ſo much to plead in <hi>excuſe</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, why they did not repent under all the mighty motives they had to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade</hi> them to it, and other means to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> them in it, it would abate or rather quite take away a great part of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned, which do ariſe from a ſenſe of their groſs, wilful and obſtinate neglect to hearken to thoſe powerful motives they once had to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to repent, and to make uſe of thoſe helps and means they once had to aſſiſt them in it. If they could but plead the impoſſibility of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the account of Gods not vouchſafing them the irreſiſtible ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his grace and Spirit, which was granted to all others that eſcape periſhing, it would in a great meaſure at leaſt, abate the tormenting gnawing of the worm that never dieth. For then it would leave no place for thoſe gripes of conſcience, fierce ſelf-accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and intolerable ſelf-reflections, which proceed from the remembrance and conſideration of the loſs of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96825:96"/>opportunity they once had given them from God, of eſcaping the miſery they have brought upon themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are perpetually racked. For if they could believe that all they could have done here in this life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eſcaping of that miſerable ſtate, would have availed them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that it depended wholly upon the irreſiſtible operation of God upon them, which was altogether out of their power, they might perhaps turn their rage againſt Almighty God, for not affording them the ſame means of eſcaping, as he had done others that were ſinners as well as themſelves; but would hardly reflect upon themſelves for not doing that which was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to have done. This ill conſequence alone of the opinion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, if there were no other, were enough one would think, to detect the crookedneſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it, which yet, as I have ſaid, hath obtained ſo long as it hath done among many good men as well as others. And indeed ſhould this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96825:96"/>generally obtain among bad men, it would in all probability, be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptation upon them, to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect doing what they might do to <hi>flee from the wrath to come,</hi> and to expect that if God intends to ſave them, that one time or other he ſhould come with ſuch power upon them to convert them, as that they ſhould not be able to withſtand it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if this ſhould run in the mind of any, that God could, if he would, hinder men from refuſing his aſſiſtance, and prevent the periſhing of any by working repentance in all by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible operations of his grace: I ſhall anſwer ſuch a thought thus: That it is poſſible for God to do, whatever it is poſſible for him to will ſhould be done. Gods power hath no other bounds ſet to it, but his own Will. <hi>Whatever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in heaven and in earth, in the ſeas, and in all deep places, Pſal.</hi> 135.6. But then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to will any thing, or to do any thing which is not perfectly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96825:97"/>agreeable to his own infinite wiſdom, by which he <hi>regulates his will and all the exertions of his power.</hi> For <hi>he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things according to the counſel of his own will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. Not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prerogative or abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his will ſimply conſidered, but according to his will regulated and governed by infinite wiſdom and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. <hi>The Kings ſtrength loveth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> ſpeaking of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.4.</p>
               <p>So that we may truly ſay that God can no more do that which doth not agree with his wiſdom, than he can that which doth not agree with his truth, or with his righteouſneſs. As it is impoſſible for God to lie, ſo it is impoſſible for him to do any thing that does not become his wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Why could not God have done more for his Vineyard than he had done? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. It was not doubtleſs becauſe he had already acted therein to the utmoſt extent of his power ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96825:97"/>and abſolutely conſidered, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had done as much, all things conſidered, as became a wiſe God to do toward ſuch a People to make them good, as there he means by his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Mark ch.</hi> 6.5. ſpeaking of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſaith, <hi>that he could do no mighty work there,</hi> to wit, in his own Country, <hi>ſave that he laid his hands upon a few ſick folk, and healed them.</hi> But why could he not do as mighty works, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in his own Country as he did in other places? Doubtleſs it was not for want of power, but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill temper of the people there, and the vehement prejudice they had againſt him, he did not think it fit for him, meet or convenient to do ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo mighty works there, as he did elſewhere. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>he did not many mighty works there, becauſe of their unbelief, chap.</hi> 13.58. Lo here we ſee the wiſdom of our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the acting of his power in things tending to work faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in men.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:96825:98"/>
               <p>Every one knows that it is matter of <hi>wiſdom</hi> in a Governour to try men by committing to them leſſer truſts at firſt. And if they quit themſelves well under thoſe, then to commit grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truſts to them, and ſo to prefer them by degrees. But if they miſcarry under thoſe leſſer truſts, they do not onely forbear committing to them greater, but alſo withdraw from them thoſe leſſer truſts which had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. And this they do upon that rational principle mentioned by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.10. <hi>He that is faithful in that which is leaſt, will be faithful alſo in much; and he which is unfaithful in the leaſt, will be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And according to this rule of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, God himſelf proceeds ordinarily, in vouchſafing his aſſiſtances unto men, in order to their performing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe, as our Saviour hath told us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. and repeated the ſame, <hi>chap.</hi> 25.29. in that ſaying; <hi>To every one that hath ſhall be given, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96825:98"/>he ſhall have abundance; and from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> God begins with men by awakening their natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, in cauſing thoughts to ariſe in their minds about their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, and what may become of their ſouls when this life is over, and about the tendency of good and evil ways. And when this operation of God upon their minds is not ſlighted but attended to, and thoughts of this nature revolved in their minds, ſo that they do but <hi>incline</hi> to amend their lives, and to take ſome care of their ſouls, then God comes in with more and further aſſiſtance, and ſo on, if that be attended to alſo, until he hath wrought thoſe firſt <hi>inclinations into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and then thoſe reſolutions into actual endeavours,</hi> till at laſt he brings them up to a performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>But if men make no uſe of theſe leſſer beginnings of God with them in thoſe preparatory aſſiſtances, to the ends
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96825:99"/>aforeſaid, but neglect and ſlight them, and at laſt oppoſe them, and harden themſelves againſt them, ſo that they grow worſe rather than better under them; then Almighty God, after he hath thus ſtriven with them as long as he thinks fit, at laſt leaves them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by withdrawing thoſe aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he had before afforded them; and ſo <hi>takes away from them that which they had,</hi> becauſe they did not make any uſe of it to the end for which it was given them.</p>
               <p>Now this method of Gods procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with men, is repreſented in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as a thing which is <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> that is, which <hi>becomes</hi> the wiſdom and righteouſneſs of God as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World. Thus for inſtance in the loweſt kind; when God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the Gentiles to operate upon their minds by principles of natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to work in them ſo much knowledge and ſenſe of himſelf by his works and otherwiſe, as to leave them <hi>without excuſe,</hi> and yet <hi>they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96825:99"/>God in acknowledgment, nor glorifie him as God, nor were thankful</hi> for his undeſerved favours; made no good uſe of theſe lower beginnings of God with them; then <hi>God gave them up to a reprobate mind, and to vile affections,</hi> took off and withdrew that reſtraint which his beginning aſſiſtances put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And this dealing of God with them, S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls a <hi>recompence</hi> which was <hi>meet,</hi> ſuch as was fit and becoming the wiſdom, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of God the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, and ſuch as was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable upon all accounts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27.</p>
               <p>Thoſe in the Parable of our Saviour who were invited to the Wedding Feaſt, and yet would not come, but ſlighted it, though they were told what preparations were made for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, are ſaid to be <hi>unworthy, Matt.</hi> 22.8. There would have been no <hi>decorum</hi> or comlineſs in forcing the Wedding Feaſt upon ſuch, whether they would or no. The invitation ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96825:100"/>Gods application to the minds of men, to draw them to do that by which they might become partakers of the bleſſings by Chriſt held forth in the Goſpel. Their obſtinate refuſing to do which, is that which makes them <hi>unworthy</hi> of thoſe benefits, and of Gods <hi>further applications</hi> to them to make them capable of them. Thus the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious Jews, when they put the Goſpel away from them, when it brought a tender of ſalvation to them, they thereby judged themſelves <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> of everlaſting life, and <hi>unworthy</hi> alſo of Gods further applications to them: for thereupon the Apoſtles left them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable that our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf gives thanks unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>hiding</hi> thoſe things from the wiſe and prudent, which he <hi>revealed</hi> unto Babes: which is an argument of the wiſdom and comlineſs of Gods proceeding thus with men, in denying them the <hi>after-aſſiſtances</hi> of his grace, that have hardened themſelves againſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96825:100"/>
                  <hi>his firſt:</hi> and our Saviours words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo much when he ſays, <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight, Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe teſtimonies from Scripture, the nature and reaſon of the thing ſhews it to be ſeemly and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thing in God, and agreeable to the higheſt wiſdom, for him as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, not irreſiſtibly to work grace in thoſe that oppoſe it to the uttermoſt in all other applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God makes to them. It becomes the wiſdom of God to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Creatures according to the frame and conſtitution of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he hath given them. Man then being made an intelligent and free agent, endued with reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and liberty of will to chuſe or refuſe according to the dictates of his mind and judgment, it muſt needs be moſt congruous and becoming the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in governing this kind of Creature, to give him ſuch Laws as by which he might know what is fit
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96825:101"/>for him to chuſe and what to refuſe. And God having given him ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch laws as are ſuitable to it, it is moſt congruous to leave him to the freedom of his own choice, and finally to determine him to the end of the way he makes choice of, whether it be life or death. And it is ſo more eſpecially when death is not awarded unto any, until they have firſt ſlighted and withſtood thoſe applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God hath made to them to warn them of their danger, and to take them off from proceeding in ſuch ways as inevitably tend to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now when God hath many and many a time over-done thus with men, and yet they will take no warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor be perſuaded to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their ſouls, what can be done to give ſuch men grace, and to ſave them? unleſs God ſhould depart from his own rules of government, and the terms he hath fixed of giving and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding grace, of rewarding and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing men. And this in wiſdom he cannot do, ſince they were eſtabliſhed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96825:101"/>by himſelf in wiſdom and counſel at the firſt.</p>
               <p>When our Saviour hath ſaid it as the Law of Heaven, and the will of the Almighty, <hi>that from him that hath not ſhall be taken away that which he hath,</hi> meaning that which he had, but did not uſe; how can ſuch men as have had aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God afforded them, but have made no uſe of it, ever hope that God ſhould give them grace &amp; ſave them? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they could promiſe themſelves that he is ſo fond of them, as for their ſakes to wave his own eſtabliſhed laws and rules, and to do it for them in a way of prerogative above his own law? A thing which they can never with any colour of reaſon expect, unleſs they could ſuppoſe their caſe <hi>compaſſionable:</hi> for none elſe but a <hi>compaſſionable caſe</hi> is ſo much as an <hi>object of mercy.</hi> But for ſuch as theſe who harden themſelves againſt all terms of mercy, when ſuch terms have often and long been affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, together with great motives to perſuade them to accept of them,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96825:102"/>and aſſiſtance to enable them to do ſo; how can it poſſibly be imagined that their caſe can be compaſſionable? May they not as well think the caſe of the Devils themſelves compaſſionable? yea, much better, who never had ſuch tenders of mercy and recovery made them, nor rejected ſuch terms as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have done.</p>
               <p>Beſides the adminiſtration of Juſtice in puniſhing obſtinate criminals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a good and wiſe Governour as well as Mercy, towards thoſe whoſe caſe is truly compaſſionable; and ſo it doth God in the adminiſtration of his Government. And if ſuch criminals as thoſe I have now mentioned, be not the objects of Gods ſeverity, I think there will none be found throughout the whole race of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I have noted to ſhew for what reaſon we may conceive God in his wiſdom doth not [though we ſhould ſuppoſe that he could] cauſe the mighty motives of Religion to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96825:102"/>effectually upon the moſt refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinners, in a way of perſuaſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſtroying that liberty which is eſſential to the will, ſo as thereby to bring them to repentance.</p>
               <p>But though I need not ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor to lay any ſtreſs upon it, yet it is thought by ſome impoſſible in the nature of the thing, for that liberty which is eſſential to the will as ſuch, to be preſerved, and at the ſame time for the will to be irreſiſtibly conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; theſe being things inconſiſtent. And if ſo, then the will cannot be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly forced, without altering the humane ſpecies by that very act. And if this ſhould be true (and I cannot ſee how it can fairly be denied) it would be reaſon enough of it ſelf to ſatisfie any man, why God hath not thought fit to work grace in men by an irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible operation.</p>
               <p>For if God ſhould deprive man of all liberty of will to chuſe or refuſe in things of a moral nature, and govern
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96825:103"/>him meerly by his power, he would thereby take him from under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by laws, and then there would be no place left either for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or vice, future rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as there is not among irrational Creatures, who are under no ſuch laws as man is, having no ſuch nature as as man hath. It is the <hi>ſpontaneouſneſs,</hi> the voluntarineſs of an action as refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a law, that makes it vertuous or vitious, and ſo rewardable or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable in another world. <hi>If I do it willingly, I have a reward,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul: Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James.</hi> It was no vertue in <hi>Balaam</hi> to bleſs <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo long as he did it onely by conſtraint, no more than it was in his Aſs to reprove him. If you can ſuppoſe a man to do any thing meerly by virtue of an extrinſecal power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, without the leaſt conſent of his own will, that in a <hi>moral ſenſe</hi> is not the act of the man, but is wholly owing to that power, by which it was neceſſitated to be done.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:96825:103"/>
               <p>Men are too too apt to preſume un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly upon the goodneſs and mercy of God to their own hurt, and to think it inconſiſtent with his <hi>natural goodneſs</hi> being infinite, not to ſave them if he can. And therefore to undeceive men in this matter, I have inſiſted the more on theſe things, and to ſhew how agreeable it is to the Divine Wiſdom, for God to withdraw his aſſiſtance from men, after they have obſtinatery perſiſted in refuſing and oppoſing it in its deſign upon them. And if it be agreeable to his wiſdom, it cannot be diſagreeable to his goodneſs: for it is as well goodneſs in God to controul Vice, as it is for him to encourage Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in what way, and by what methods ſeems beſt unto him.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of difference between true love and goodneſs, and <hi>fondneſs.</hi> Men by fondneſs love many times without reaſon, and beſtow their favours more than becomes them. But true and generous goodneſs governs it ſelf by wiſdom and prudence, and ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96825:104"/>it doth in God. The wiſdom of God will not ſuffer his goodneſs to throw away his ſaving benefits upon thoſe who by incapacitating themſelves to enjoy them, have rendred themſelves altogether unworthy of them. For it would diſparage the wiſdom, and ſo the goodneſs of God the donor, in caſe he ſhould confer them upon ſuch, becauſe his different affection to evil and good, would be thereby in a great meaſure obſcured, and the ſinews of his Government weakned. <hi>Honour is not ſeemly for a Fool,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.1. As it will not become the Fool himſelf, ſo neither will it become the wiſdom of him that confers it, to place it on one ſo uncapable of it as a Fool is.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the after-aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, which thoſe receive, who have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted already to perform the condition of the promiſe, as new beginners in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THoſe who have been aſſiſted by God to repent, believe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and therein to begin their performance of the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life, do ſtill ſtand in need of his further aſſiſtance to <hi>perſevere,</hi> and to continue to do ſo to their lives end, and to do it more and more <hi>excellently.</hi> For as Believers hold their title in the benefits promiſed no longer than they continue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition on which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of them is made, ſo neither do they continue in the performance of that condition longer than they are aſſiſted by God to do ſo. Now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in performing the condition of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96825:105"/>the promiſe, is as neceſſary for men to continue their title to the benefits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as their performance of that condition at the firſt was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it.</p>
               <p>For the promiſe runs thus: <hi>He that ſhall endure to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Mat. 24.13. <hi>And to him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and keepeth my works unto the end, will I give power over the Nations,</hi> Rev. 2.26. <hi>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſs, and committeth iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all the righteouſneſs which he hath done ſhall not be mentioned: in the treſpaſs which he hath treſpaſſed, and in the ſin which he hath ſinned, in them he ſhall die,</hi> Ezek. 18.24.</p>
               <p>And as this perſeverance is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the reaſon and end aforeſaid, ſo is <hi>a conſtant and continual aſſiſtance from God</hi> to enable the Diſciples of Chriſt ſo to perſevere. As the ſame power is neceſſary to continue the natural life, which firſt gave being to it, ſo is it in the ſpiritual life and ſtate alſo. <hi>Ye
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96825:105"/>are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>
               <p>And that which is very remarkable touching this After-aſſiſtance of which I ſpeak, is, That a greater preſence and more conſtant aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God is promiſed and vouchſafed unto men after they believe, than they had before. This appears by having <hi>the Holy Spirit given them after,</hi> in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which they had not before; and by <hi>Gods dwelling, and the Spirits abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them after,</hi> who did not do ſo before.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thoſe who have believed the Goſpel and ſincerely delivered up themſelves to the conduct of it in their lives, do thereby come under that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial priviledge of having the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit given them,</hi> to aſſiſt, influence, and quicken them, and to carry on the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96825:106"/>work of ſanctification in them. This our Saviour promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>Jeſus cried, ſaying, he that believeth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water: this,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him ſhould receive.</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Which promiſes we find made good afterwards in ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Of the Believers it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. <hi>that they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter, are witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is the Holy Ghoſt, whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them that obey him.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſaith, <hi>After ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> chap. 1.13. that is, they were marked for his, and diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that were not, by his giving them the Spirit. <hi>For if any man have not the Spirit of Chhiſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>Senſual not having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Jude 19.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:96825:106"/>
               <p>It is true indeed, thoſe firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and others after for ſome time, did receive the Holy Spirit in a ſenſe that was peculiar to thoſe times, for the confirmation and propagation of the Chriſtian Religion, until it was well ſetled, and had taken ſome roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the World. As when they were in an extraordinary way enabled by the Spirit to ſpeak with other tongues, and to perform other miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operations, as our Saviour had foretold they ſhould. <hi>For theſe ſigns,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall follow them that believe in my name; in my name they ſhall caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new tongues, &amp;c. Mark</hi> 16.17. A more full and particular enumeration of which extraordinary gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſcattered among the Believers of thoſe times, we have in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe, the Believers then received in receiving the Holy Spirit, an increaſe of gracious qualifications, called the <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> ſuch <hi>as love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96825:107"/>goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> as the Apoſtle reckons them up, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And in this ſenſe the Holy Spirit hath been given to all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ever ſince, and is now. <hi>For if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> he is no true Chriſtian, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.</p>
               <p>By mens having the Spirit then, and by the Spirits being given them after they believe, is meant, I conceive, a more <hi>conſtant</hi> and a more <hi>plentiful</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and effuſion of the Spirit to change and renew them, to reſtore them to the likeneſs of God, to the ſpirit and temper of Jeſus Chriſt, than ever was vouchſafed them towards their believing, or by enabling them to believe at firſt. Before men repent, believe, or begin to obey, they have the Spirit at work in their minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to ſuggeſt to their thoughts and conſiderations, things of higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to them, and to incline them to look after them in time, and before the day of grace and ſalvation is over
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96825:107"/>and gone. He then at times ſtands at the door and knocks, and ſtrives with every man, and vouchſafes to ſuch more and more of his aſſiſtance, until they are enabled to believe, who do not make faſt the door againſt him, but rather open to him and refuſe not to be led on by degrees. The more they attended to the teaching of the Father by his Spirit, and the nearer they came to believe indeed, the more frequent viſits they had from him, and the more aſſiſtance. But after they have followed on ſo far, and become ſo teachable as to believe indeed and ſincerely, to give up themſelves to his conduct, then he communicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more freely and more conſtantly to them than ever before, in divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and aſſiſtance to root and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them in the Chriſtian Faith and Life, and to carry them on further and further towards perfection.</p>
               <p>This, ſecondly, is ſet out to us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vein of Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as ſpeak of <hi>Gods dwelling in true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:96825:108"/>and ſincere Chriſtians, and of their being <hi>the temple of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> of which nature are many texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. and 4.13, 16. By all which is ſignified the <hi>more conſtant reſidence of the Holy Spirit</hi> in and with men after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and become true Chriſtians, to aſſiſt them in their great affairs for their ſouls and another World, as one that is never long abſent from them, but ready at hand at all times to help them in doing their duty, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come temptations, unleſs by grieving him, they cauſe him to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him, John</hi> 14.23.</p>
               <p>This giving of the Holy Spirit to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians to be <hi>always with them</hi> as his <hi>dwelling in them</hi> implies, is not onely to help and aſſiſt them to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96825:108"/>in doing onely ſo much as will entitle them to pardon and life <hi>barely,</hi> as their performing the condition of the promiſe, though but in the loweſt ſenſe of performance will do: But Gods deſign in giving his Spirit to them after they have perform'd the condition in the loweſt ſenſe, is to fit and prepare them for <hi>greater degrees</hi> of bleſſedneſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for a higher and more glorious exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therein, than a bare performance of the condition of the promiſe in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſideration, and in the loweſt degree of performance will well bear.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour came, as he ſays, <hi>that we might have life, and that we might have it in abundance, John</hi> 10.10. not barely to ſave us, but to exalt us to ſuch a height of glory, that the glory and bleſſedneſs of his Body, the Church, might hold ſome good proportion with his own glory and bleſſedneſs, as Head of it. And to encourage true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to endeavour to excel in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs, in order to this, there are other conditional promiſes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96825:109"/>made, beſides that of pardon and life upon condition of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſimply conſidered. To ſuch as <hi>give all diligence</hi> in <hi>adding</hi> to their Faith Vertue, Knowledge, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Patience, Godlineſs, Brotherly kindneſs and Charity, ſo that theſe things be in them and <hi>abound,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is of an <hi>abundant entrance</hi> into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. And he that <hi>ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>And he that humbleth himſelf as a little child, the ſame is greateſt in the Kingdom of heaven, Mat.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Veſſels of Mercy</hi> will hold more or leſs glory, according to their different capacities in grace and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as they are made larger or leſſer. By how much the more near Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians come to Chriſt in goodneſs, by ſo much they are qualified to be the more near to him in happineſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But ſtill, as I ſay, this greater and more conſtant preſence of the Spirit is given to true Chriſtians after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96825:109"/>to carry on this great and glorious deſign of grace towards them, to take them out of the ſpirit of this World, and to lift them up in holineſs and goodneſs, thereby to make them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the greater glory and happineſs.</p>
               <p>To make this plain and familiar to our thoughts, let it be conſidered, that upon mens unfeigned believing, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows immediately their <hi>adoption. As many as received him, to them he gave power, right, or priviledge to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name, John</hi> 1.12. This is a very great advancement indeed, and holds ſome proportion to that deep humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our Saviour underwent to prepare our way to it. Now thoſe whom God adopts to be <hi>ſons,</hi> thoſe he adopts to be <hi>heirs</hi> alſo to his great <hi>inheritance</hi> and glorious eſtate: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if children then heirs, heirs of God, yea joint-heirs with Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p>This being their happy caſe; the bleſſed God and Father, who hath
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96825:110"/>adopted the Believers for his children and heirs, gives them his Holy Spirit to be always with them, puts his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them to tutor and diſcipline them, and to give them thereby ſuch breeding as may ſit and prepare them for ſo high a relation, and for ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an inheritance as that is which he intends to ſettle upon them. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Gal.</hi> 4.6. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the happy ſtate which he, with other the Believers, expect and long for after the diſſolution of this earthly tabernacle in which the ſoul now dwells, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ſaith in <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing, is God, who alſo hath given unto us the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi> His giving them his Spirit to ſit them for that inheritance, is an <hi>earneſt</hi> or pledge that he does really intend to beſtow it upon them. When he ſaith, He that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing is God, we hereby ſee that it is the work of God by his Spirit to frame
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96825:110"/>frame and faſhion the Believers for that magnificent eſtate in the next World which is prepared for them, and to which they are adopted. This work of God upon them, is <hi>to make them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, Gal.</hi> 1.12. Theſe Believers are thoſe <hi>Veſſels of Mercy whom he thus afore prepares unto glory, Rom.</hi> 9.23. It is the benevolent work and buſineſs of our Lord and Saviour by his Spirit, ſo <hi>to ſanctifie and cleanſe</hi> the whole Society of Believers, <hi>that he may preſent them to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> and to beautifie and adorn them as a Bride for ſuch a Husband as Jeſus Chriſt is, and will appear to be in the day of the manifeſtation of all his glory, that he may not be aſhamed to own them for ſuch.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee another of the ends for which Chriſtians receive a greater and more conſtant preſence and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Spirit after they believe than they did before, is to fit
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96825:111"/>and prepare them for greater glory and happineſs than the loweſt degree of performing the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as at the firſt will make them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. We will now a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in what, or wherein the Holy Spirit doth aſſiſt the Believers, when they grow up thereby unto more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Chriſtian life.</p>
               <p>One of the firſt things I conceive he does is, to <hi>ſtir</hi> them up <hi>to,</hi> and to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> them <hi>in</hi> making prayers, and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Almighty God, for the working in them that which is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in his ſight. For although God be ready to bleſs them with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, yet not without being ſought unto to do it for them. And accordingly they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed but upon that condition; <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, Matth.</hi> 7.7. Otherwiſe it will fare with them as it did with thoſe S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks to, <hi>James</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye have not becauſe ye ask not.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:96825:111"/>
               <p>Now to the end therefore that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may receive ſuch an increaſe and growth in all divine Vertues, as by means whereof they may live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Goſpel, and be made meet for the celeſtial glory, the Holy Spirit doth aſſiſt them to make <hi>requeſts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, and helpeth their infirmities,</hi> when otherwiſe <hi>they know not how to pray as they ought,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. <hi>Almighty God poureth on them the Spirit of grace and ſupplication,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. He helps them not onely to pray for ſuch things as they ought, but alſo in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they ſhould, to wit, with a great ſenſe of their own wants and of their own unworthineſs to obtain, and of the worth and excellency, and defire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings they pray for. He helps them to pray with ſeriouſneſs and devotion of ſoul, and with an humble fervency accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſighs and groans, which cannot well be uttered by them many times. He helps them alſo to pray in faith concerning the goodneſs of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96825:112"/>nature of God, and his readineſs to give and to forgive; and concerning the prevailing interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed Advocate. God ſends forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts <hi>crying, Abba Father,</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them in their Addreſſes to God, to depend upon him as their Father, and humbly to expect to be uſed and dealt with by him in all reſpects as a Father, while they reſolve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to carry it toward him as his children.</p>
               <p>And when the Holy Spirit enables them to pray thus, they may be ſaid <hi>to pray in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as Jude 20. <hi>to make prayers and ſupplications in the Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18.</p>
               <p>And when the Holy Spirit hath thus holpen the Believers to ſeek thoſe things of God which pertain to life and godlineſs, grace, ſtrength, and ability to overcome corruptions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to live a ſober, righteous, and a godly life; then the Holy Spirit in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96825:112"/>way of return to ſuch prayers, doth <hi>aſſiſt</hi> them in their endeavours in the <hi>uſe of means,</hi> to attain thoſe things they have begged of God. This we are well aſſured of by our Saviour himſelf, when we compare his ſaying as related by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> with the ſame as related by S. <hi>Luke.</hi> In <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. he ſaith, <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven give good things to them that ask him?</hi> Or how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give <hi>his Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. From both which compared, we learn, that God is moſt ready and willing to give thoſe that ſeriouſly ask them out of a ſenſe of their want of them, all graces or gracious qualifications and diſpoſitions of ſoul, neceſſary to their pleaſing of God, by giving them his Holy Spirit to work them in them: Or that by giving them his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he gives them all thoſe good things; becauſe when the Spirit is given unto men, it is to work thoſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96825:113"/>good things in them, by way of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>This might be ſhewed in particular inſtances; I ſhall mention ſome. When we <hi>crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> when <hi>weeleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> when we <hi>mortifie the deeds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> it is ſtill by the help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Gods Spirit that it is done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Gods Spirit in his Servants <hi>luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi> as the fleſh doth againſt the Spirit: it draws a contrary way, and therein prevails againſt the fleſh. The fleſh calls upon men to be gratified in this and that, in things either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in themſelves, or in that degree which is unlawful. But the Spirit calls upon us, by exciting thoughts in us, to mind and regard our ſouls, and by no means to wrong them by diſturbing their peace, or hazarding their ſafety, to gratifie the fleſh with momentary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which will leave guilt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the mind, when they are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96825:113"/>and gone themſelves. And the Spirit by frequent prevailing herein, comes at laſt to kill this itch in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Again, when the Believers minds and wills become more and more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to their duty,</hi> and to be in love with it, in all the inſtances of it both towards God and towards men, it is ſtill through the help of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that they are ſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.</hi> That they obey the truth in what it requires, it is through the Spirit, ſtrengthening and quickening them thereto, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the motives thereto, preſent to their thoughts. In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.12. it is ſaid, <hi>that in Juda the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King and of the Princes by the word of the Lord.</hi> The hand of God upon the heart, as well as the word of the Lord by the miniſtry of men, is that by which mens wills are bowed and inclined to what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <hi>He that keepeth his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96825:114"/>dwelleth in him, and he in him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. Our keeping the commandments is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derce of Gods dwelling in us, becauſe it is the effect of his preſence with us to aſſiſt us therein; he argues from the effect to the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Again, it is the effect of the Holy Spirits preſence with Believers, and of his operation in them, when their minds and ſpirits become purified and refined from inordinateneſs of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and unrulineſs of paſſion, until by degrees they are brought in ſome good meaſure unto <hi>a likeneſs and conformity to the ſpirit and temper of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Scholars they are. <hi>They that are joined to the Lord are one ſpirit.</hi> They mind, love, hate, and deſign the ſame things which our Saviour doth. They participate of that love, gentleneſs, benignity and goodneſs which was ſo eminent in him <hi>(the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs, righteouſneſs, and truth, Epheſ.</hi> 5.9.) by which means they come to <hi>be in the world as he was in the world,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:96825:114"/>as S. <hi>Johns</hi> phraſe is. <hi>Hereby,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us, Joh.</hi> 3.24. It is ſo like him, that it muſt needs come from him, and if it be in us, it is becauſe he dwells in us. <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.12. When we love one another as Chriſt hath loved us, when we are merciful as our heavenly Father is mercciful, his love and goodneſs is ſo reſembled by us, as that it is perfectly diſcernible in us.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Holy Spirit is given to the Believers, to be with them, to ſtrengthen them with reſolution and courage to hold on their courſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living, and cleaving faithfully to Chriſt, notwithſtanding all oppoſition and diſcouragement they may meet with from the World in doing ſo. To this end they are <hi>ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,</hi> Epheſ. 3.16. <hi>For God hath not given them the ſpirit of fear, but of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96825:115"/>power and love, and of a ſound mind,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given to the Believers to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with them, to maintain and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in them <hi>a comfortable and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame of ſpirit,</hi> and ſo to keep them <hi>from fainting,</hi> when they are <hi>called to ſuffer</hi> for the ſake of our Saviour, or his truth or doctrine. And it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from this effect among others, of the Spirits abiding with the Believers, that he is ſtiled <hi>the Comforter.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon principally, the joy which they have amidſt their ſufferings for righteouſneſs ſake, is called <hi>the joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.6. <hi>having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And well may it be called the joy of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe ſolid joy under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, can proceed from no other cauſe but the Holy Spirits operation. It is not the manner of the World as it is with Believers, to rejoice in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in wrongs and injuries, and hard
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96825:115"/>uſage from men, but the contrary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no principle in them, out of which ſuch a thing ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. And therefore our Savior ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you, Joh.</hi> 14.27. The Holy Spirit can raiſe joy, yea great joy in the ſouls of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt when they ſuffer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hard meaſure from the hands of men, ſo long as they know it is for their faithfulneſs to their bleſſed Lord and Maſter, who hath ſuffered and done ſo much for them as he hath done. The Spirit of God can ſo order their thoughts within them, that they ſhall not look upon themſelves as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced thereby, but as highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Maſter, by giving them both opportunity and courage to do him that honour when his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would caſt reproach and ſhame upon him and his Cauſe, and all that appear for it. And thus the Apoſtles <hi>when they had been beaten, departed from the Council, rejoicing that they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the name
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96825:116"/>of Jeſus their Lord, Acts</hi> 5.41. The Holy Ghoſt can ſuggeſt to them alſo, that a great deal of good by ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may be done to others in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to think the more and the better of the Chriſtian Religion, when they ſee with what chearfulneſs the Profeſſors of it can ſuffer for its ſake. When the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> received the Word in much affliction, and yet with joy of the Holy Ghoſt, they became thereby <hi>enſamples to all that believed in Macedonia and Achaia,</hi> and from them and their deportment in ſuffering for the Goſpel, <hi>the word of the Lord ſounded out, not onely in Macedonia and Achaia, but alſo in every place their faith was ſpread abroad and talked of.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8. It was this joyous deportment of the primitive Martyrs in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that tended ſo greatly to the increaſe and enlargement of the Church, as Hiſtory relates it did.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians then were enabled <hi>to glory in tribulation</hi> of this kind, in as much as they were guided to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96825:116"/>that this <hi>patient enduring</hi> without repining, would give them <hi>experience</hi> of their ſincerity and fidelity in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Chriſt; and then this <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> would give them <hi>hope,</hi> ſuch as ſhould not make them <hi>aſhamed</hi> through any diſappointment, but great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards God of being accepted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4.</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but alſo touching the greatneſs of the reward which is laid up in heaven for ſuch; <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Upon account whereof our Saviour bids them to <hi>rejoice and to be exceeding glad, yea to leap for joy in that day,</hi> when they ſhould be perſecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake, and have their name caſt out as evil, and the like. When the Chriſtians were enabled <hi>to ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> yea and of their lives too, not onely with patience, but alſo with <hi>joyfulneſs:</hi> when they were <hi>as ſorrowing, and yet always rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;</hi> whence was this? And how can it be imagined that they ſhould ever
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96825:117"/>be able to do, and to be ſo, but that they <hi>were ſtrengthened with all might according to Gods glorious power, unto all patience and long-ſuffering with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>The Spirit of God and of glory, then reſted upon them</hi> as the other Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. How came S. <hi>Stephen</hi> to ſtand with ſuch an undaunted courage before the Council, as if his face had been the face of an Angel? Why it was becauſe <hi>he was full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> he had a mighty preſence of the Spirit with him to enable him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> learned by experience, that as his ſufferings did abound for Chriſt, ſo <hi>his conſolations by Chriſt did abound alſo,</hi> (2 Cor. 1.5.) that <hi>when he was weak, then he was ſtrong;</hi> that he had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier preſence, a more powerful and comfortable influence of the Holy Spirit in times of great trials and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt, than he had at other times. And this experience of his made him ſo far from being afraid of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96825:117"/>ſuffering, that for the ſake of that wonderful comfort which was wont to come along with ſuffering, he was rather glad when ſuffering came, than any way dejected and caſt down for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me. Therefore I take pleaſure in infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes, for Chriſts ſake: for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> Their hope that God would make good to them his exceeding great and precious promiſes, was at ſuch time raiſed very high, made lively, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſtrong, by the Spirit of God. <hi>Rejoycing in hope,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> in one place, <hi>abounding in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> in another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. and 15.13. When the Holy Ghoſt did put forth himſelf, did exert his power in raiſing the Chriſtians hope, it is no marvel then if they did abound therein; that is, that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations roſe very high, were vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſtrong, and very affecting, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96825:118"/>them with ſuch joy as over-topp'd, and in a great meaſure ſwallowed up the ſenſe of their ſufferings.</p>
               <p>And thus I have endeavoured to ſhew how the Spirit of God doth aſſiſt the Believers to do more than meerly to perſevere and hold out in performing the condition of the promiſe under the ſoreſt trials and greateſt temptations to the contrary; for it enables them to glory and rejoice under them, and ſo to be more than conquerors, to fight the good fight of Faith, to finiſh their courſe, to keep the Faith, and all in order to their laying hold of eternal life.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this matter: all theſe and other like aſſiſtances, influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conſolations of the good Spirit of God, by which the Believers are prepared for glory, are, I conceive, the things meant by S. <hi>Paul</hi> by that <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or rather <hi>Communication of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which he in his Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal benediction ſeriouſly deſired and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96825:118"/>invoked in the behalf of the Chriſtians when he diſmiſſed them thus; <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God, and the communion</hi> or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all. Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. For as he wiſhed them the comfort and benefit that flows from the grace or charity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, expreſſed in his Mediatorial performance, and from the love of God, from which that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: So he did likewiſe the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of thoſe aſſiſtances and graces of the Holy Spirit, by which they might be enabled to do their part in performing what was required of themſelves in order thereunto.</p>

               <p>HAving thus far ſhewed, as well as I could, what aſſiſtance men receive from God in performing the condition of the promiſe of pardon and life: it will be neceſſary now to add ſomething by way of Caution.</p>

               </p>
               <p>God doubtleſs does expect when he hath awakened in men a ſenſe of their danger by reaſon of ſin; and hath ſet before them what he hath done, and Chriſt hath done to reſcue and deliver them from it; and what muſt be done by themſelves to make them capable of the bleſſed effects of our Saviours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in obtaining pardon and life; and what aſſiſtance they ſhall have to that end, if they will but truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do what they can do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: I ſay when God hath ſet all this before them, he expects that they ſhould put forth themſelves in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours tending towards the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition of the promiſe.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96825:120"/>ſo? Again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Circumciſe your ſelves unto the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts.</hi> Acts 2.40. <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward generation.</hi> And all the precepts, exhortations and perſuaſions in Scripture to repent, to believe, to obey, are of the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Such for inſtance, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>But now God commandeth all men every where to repent.</hi> Chap. 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized.</hi> Chap. 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted;</hi> and the like. Theſe Scriptures imply, and ſuppoſe that men can do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards repenting, towards turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and making them a new heart, or elſe we muſt ſuppoſe that God commandeth, preſſeth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeth men to do that, towards which he knows they can do nothing. The latter of which to ſuppoſe, would be to ſuppoſe the Scriptures to make the ſame bad repreſentation of God with the ſlothful ſervant in the Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is <hi>a hard Maſter, expecting to reap where he hath not ſown, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where he hath not ſcattered.</hi> And
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96825:121"/>who would not abhor to faſten that upon God, which is not conſiſtent with the goodneſs of a man? We know what it ſignified in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to require the full tale of Brick, when he did not give the people Straw wherewith to make them. And God forbid we ſhould repreſent the good God to our ſelves in the likeneſs of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, for any to ſay that men are wholly <hi>paſſive</hi> in performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe, is to lay a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon themſelves and others, not to endeavour to perform it, nor to do any thing towards it. For who will attempt to do, or endeavour to do that which they believe impoſſible to be done by them? And for men not to endeavor to do what they can towards the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that condition, is the <hi>directeſt courſe</hi> they can take to <hi>deprive</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> from God by which they might have performed it. <hi>For from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. Him that hath
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96825:121"/>not; that is, him that hath not uſed what he had; as we may ſee by him that had the one talent, and had it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, becauſe he did not uſe it. And that this is the meaning of thoſe words, From him that hath not, ſhall be taken away that which he hath, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by our Saviours next words, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. by which he explains that ſaying of his: <hi>Therefore ſpeak I to them in Parables, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not; and hearing, they hear not:</hi> Meaning that they had as it were eyes, but did not ſee with them, and ears, but did not hear with them: that is, they had means by which they might have ſeen and heard, and underſtood ſo much as would have made them capable of further diſcoveries and aſſiſtances, but did not make uſe of them, and therfore thoſe farther diſcoveries and aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were with-held from them, which yet were granted to the Diſciples.</p>
               <p>What our Saviour here ſaid in this matter, was in anſwer to a queſtion of the Diſciples, who asked him, ſaying, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou to them in Parables?
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96825:122"/>Verſe</hi> 10. And his anſwer was, <hi>Becauſe it was not given unto them</hi> (the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Jews) <hi>to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven,</hi> as it was to the Diſciples. And the reaſon why it was not given, was as he ſhews, becauſe they ſeeing ſaw not, and hearing heard not. They had eyes and ears to ſee and hear with, but did not uſe them for the ends for which they received them. They had not heard and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Father by attending to, or regarding his methods of preparing men for the Faith of the Goſpel. They had not attended unto thoſe things which natural Religion it ſelf would have taught them, and which they might have ſeen by the natural light of their minds, as well as they ſaw external objects with the eyes of their bodies, if they had not ſhut them: Nor had they learned by his teaching them by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. And becauſe they did not uſe what they had before, therefore it was that more aſſiſtance was not given them to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96825:122"/>That this was the reaſon of it, is yet further confirmed by what our Saviour ſaid on the other hand, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Fathers will) <hi>he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> For by this we ſee, that if theſe Jews to whom it was not given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom, had been inclined and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their own minds by former motives, to have done the will of God which they already knew, as others of them were, it would have been given unto them as well as it was to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, to have known thoſe myſteries. The reaſon therefore why this further knowledge was not given them, was becauſe they had no mind to do what they had been taught by God; by a teaching antecedent to his teaching them by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By all which we may ſee that men cannot take a more direct courſe, as I ſay, to deprive themſelves of that aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God, by which they might
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96825:123"/>perform the condition of the promiſe, than by neglecting to do what they may and can do through Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace towards that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. And if ſo, then that opinion muſt needs be of a very dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that does incline men to ſuch a neglect: And yet ſuch is the opinion that men are wholly <hi>paſſive</hi> in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the condition of the promiſe. For what can be a greater check (as I have ſaid) to mens endeavours to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any thing, than an opinion that they can do nothing towards it. Men are very prone to govern themſelves in acting or forbearing to act, by their principles and the notions they have of things: if theſe be corrupt, that which is the conſequence of them cannot be ſound. Mens errour in practice, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much owing to the errour of their minds, and wrong notions of things; <hi>They do alway err in their heart, for they have not known my ways,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.10. there the errour in life and practice begins. If men have wrong notions in their minds of Gods
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96825:123"/>ways and methods of proceeding with men in reference to their ſalvation, it can hardly be avoided but they will more or leſs err in point of ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice alſo, as is any way influenced by thoſe notions. <hi>If the light which is in you be darkneſs, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Mat.</hi> 6.23.</p>
               <p>Almighty God gives to every man from whom he requires repentance and faith, ability to do ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, though not compleatly to repent and believe without further aſſiſtance than that which he gives at the firſt. When men therefore do but improve that little which they have, in doing that little which they can do towards their repenting and believing, God will vouchſafe them further aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ability to do yet more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; and if they do but improve that additional ability to the doing yet more towards the ſame end, God will doubtleſs vouchſafe to ſuch, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further aſſiſtance, until they acquire thereby that true faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, on which pardon and life
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96825:124"/>are promiſed. For ſo ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance,</hi> Mat. 13.12. <hi>And to you that have, more ſhall be given.</hi> And again, <hi>With what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you,</hi> Mark 4.24. All which ſayings ſeem to ſignifie, that according to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary method of proceeding with men, they ſhall have more or leſs aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him, as they do with more or leſs care and diligence uſe what they have received already.</p>
               <p>And as there is need for men to be cautioned againſt neglecting to uſe what power they have towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition of the promiſe in repenting and believing before they do repent and believe; ſo there is need likewiſe of cautioning others againſt neglecting to improve their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, and obedience, from a lower to a higher degree, from the ſtate of Babes to a manly ſtature in Chriſtianity. For there is a danger of abuſing this comfortable doctrine
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96825:124"/>of Divine Aſſiſtance, to a ſpiritual ſloth, idleneſs, and negligence, and that under pretence of honouring God, and glorifying Free-grace; as by leaving all to be done by him, that he may have the honour of all. As if men were not in confidence of Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſo in the ſtrength of the Lord to run the race ſet before them, but to be taken up into arms and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all the way to Heaven without their running or going.</p>
               <p>Whereas when men truly enter into the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſtate, and ſeriouſly ſet their faces for heaven, they then enter into a ſpiritual warfare againſt the Fleſh, World, and Devil; and they, as the Iſraelites, muſt fight for the promiſed Land before they enter it, though they receive it by promiſe as they did: they muſt <hi>firſt fight the good ſight of faith,</hi> and then <hi>lay hold of eternal life.</hi> It is <hi>he that overcometh, that ſhall inherit all things, Rev.</hi> 21.7. For men not to ſtir up themſelves, not to gird up the loins of their minds to ſight their way through to Heaven, but to reſolve to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96825:125"/>be <hi>onely paſſive,</hi> under pretence that the Captain of our ſalvation might have all the honour of the Victory, would be much what as ridiculous as it would be for Souldiers in an Army to ſay they would leave it wholly to their Captain General to fight for them while they ſit ſtill, that he might have all the honour of the Victory. The ability of God and our Saviour to ſave, hath no other limits ſave what his will directed by his infinite wiſdom hath put upon it: but the divine will hath ſo limited this power, that the <hi>promiſe of Crowning</hi> is not made but to ſuch as through ſtriving <hi>overcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the promiſes and aſſurances we have of Divine Aſſiſtance, are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our diligence and induſtry in working out and carrying quite through the buſineſs of our ſalvation, and to overcome all that doth oppoſe us, or which any way tends to hinder us in it. Of this nature is that of S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96825:125"/>for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Gods working in us, his readineſs to aſſiſt us, is given as the motive and argument to perſuade us to work out our own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If we do but put forth our ſelves to do what we can in doing our duty, though it be with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, when we conſider our own weakneſs and the ſtrength of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we are to encounter and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in doing ſo, we are aſſured of this for our encouragement, that if we do ſo, we ſhall find an inward and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret aſſiſtance from God to fortifie our reſolutions, and to bring the ſame to good effect, ſo that all our ſpiritual enemies ſhall not be able to hinder us, but that we ſhall ſtill hold on our way and grow ſtronger and ſtronger, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of the righteous, and he that hath clean hands. God will not fail to add more ſtrength to our willing and doing, in carrying on the work of grace, and ſo of ſalvation, to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter height and more perfection, if we are but faithful in endeavouring it
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96825:126"/>our ſelves. <hi>Be of good courage and God ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. The motive wherewith to perſuade men to be of good courage and firm reſolution in the way of their duty, is we ſee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then God will ſtrengthen their hearts; that is, will yield them more and further aſſiſtance, and by that means make their duty more and more eaſie to them, as it muſt needs be, to the ſame degree their ſtrength is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by which it is to be done.</p>
               <p>The Lord is ſo ready, nay ſo certain to aſſiſt his ſervants in their faithful endeavours to do their duty, that they may be as ſure of it, and as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it as if they had it in their own power. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the Chriſtians <hi>to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. As if they might reckon themſelves armed with his ſtrength, while they depend upon him for it in doing their duty. Which made S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak ſo conſidently, <hi>I can do all things
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96825:126"/>through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me, Phil.</hi> 4.13. And again, <hi>If ye through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> He accounted that if they had any mind to mortifie the deeds of the body, they might be ſure of help from the Spirit wherewith to do it, whenever in good earneſt they went about it.</p>
               <p>But when men think themſelves ſo ſure of being kept by the power of God as that they grow careleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs as to their own endeavours of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty, and ſtanding upon their guard againſt temptations, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſlip into ſuch ways and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by which the Spirit of God is <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> and withdraws from them, and with-holds his quickning influences, and then they grow dry and flat, and unſavoury too, and fall even then when they thought they ſtood ſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the like may be ſaid touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger on the other hand alſo. <hi>For when men have ſuch an opinion of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96825:127"/>their own power and ability to perform the condition of the promiſe, as that they are not mindful of the Holy Spirits aſſiſtance, nor ſenſible of their need of it, but are negligent in addreſſing to God for it, and in their dependance upon him for the ſupplies of it,</hi> it cannot be expected that the Holy Spirit ſhould take any ſuch pleaſure in ſuch men, as to take up his reſidence and make his abode with them. And if not, the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his aſſiſtance to ſuch men muſt needs be more rare and more ſparing, and his viſits leſs frequent. And when they are ſo, it will be viſible in the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, dead-heartedneſs, and barrenneſs of ſuch Chriſtians, though then they may retain a form of godlineſs.</p>
               <p>For the Holy Spirit will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſuch his ſpecial preſence and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, who do not know their need of it, nor how to prize it. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly our Saviour ſpeaking of the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> ſaith, <hi>whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, John</hi> 14.17. So
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96825:127"/>that it ſeems mens receiving the Spirit depends very much upon their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the uſefulneſs and benefit of his communications, and valuing him accordingly.</p>
               <p>So that we ſee there is danger of running into extremes on both hands; either in mens pretending ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon divine Aſſiſtance, as to neglect to do what they can do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performing the condition of the promiſe: or elſe in having ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own power and ability to perform it, as to over-look and neglect the Divine Aſſiſtance, as if they had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no need of it.</p>
               <p>Such as this latter ſort are far from the mind of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſtill care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to attribute his after, as well as his firſt Chriſtian performances to Divine Aſſiſtance. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I laboured more than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And again. <hi>I will not dare to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96825:128"/>ſpeak of any of thoſe things which Chriſt hath not wrought by me,</hi> Rom. 15.18. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. And our Saviour taught his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be of the ſame mind, when he ſaid, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing; John</hi> 15.5.</p>
               <p>And where Chriſtians are full of the ſenſe of their need of Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and accordingly highly prize it, ſeek it, and depend on God for it, and yet are withall as careful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in their own endeavours, as if all the work lay wholly on their hands. Theſe are they the Holy Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, and delights to ſpiritualize, to influence, quicken, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and to lift them up near unto Heaven, in preparing them for it. For thus ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples, ſpeaking to them of the Spirit of truth whom the World cannot receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not know him; <hi>but ye know him,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>therefore he abideth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96825:128"/>with you and ſhall be among you:</hi> for ſo Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> reads the place, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. As if he had ſaid, becauſe ye know how to value his preſence and aſſiſtance, therefore you ſhall have it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Something of the grounds of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſuch have to expect aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance fully to perform the condition of the promiſe, as have not refuſed to make uſe of Gods preparatory aſſiſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat God doth prevent all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours on our part of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, by his applications to us to make us ſenſible of the badneſs and danger of our ſinful ſtate, to diſpoſe us thereby to hearken to his merciful terms of being delivered from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we our ſelves make any one ſtep towards it; I have ſhewed before. Now thoſe who have made ſo much uſe of Gods preparatory aſſiſtance as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96825:129"/>thereupon to become inquiſitive what they ſhould do to be ſaved, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be taught. Theſe I reckon have encouragement to expect and hope to be further and further aſſiſted, until they are enabled fully to perform the condition of the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt our Saviour hath poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively aſſerted, and that more than once, <hi>that to him that hath, more ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance, Mat.</hi> 13.12. and 25.29. Which can be underſtood, I conceive, of nothing more properly than of Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and ſo he, whoſoever he be, that hath had aſſiſtance from God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performing the condition of the Goſpel-Covenant, and hath made uſe of it by uſing endeavours towards ſuch a performance, to him more ſhall be given, to wit, more aſſiſtance, until he have abundance of it, and of grace proportionably.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe who have made uſe of Gods preparatory aſſiſtance, are <hi>given</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:96825:129"/>by the Father to his Son Chriſt Jeſus, to be aſſiſted by him fully to perform the condition of the promiſe in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and obeying the Goſpel. And thoſe that are given by the Father to the Son to be thus aſſiſted, have great reaſon to be confidently perſuaded they ſhall. For our Saviour hath ſaid of ſuch, <hi>that he will in no wiſe caſt them out,</hi> but receive them as Diſciples, and treat them as becomes ſuch a Maſter.</p>
               <p>That thoſe who are given by the Father to the Son, are ſuch as have made uſe of Gods preparatory aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, appears by comparing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words in <hi>John</hi> 6.37. with thoſe in the 44 and 45 verſes. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me,</hi> ſaith he <hi>verſe</hi> 37. And in <hi>verſe</hi> 44. he ſaith, <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Now if thoſe, and onely thoſe come to Chriſt, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth him, then thoſe muſt needs
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96825:130"/>be the perſons which are given to Chriſt, which are prepared by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe all theſe, and none but theſe come to Chriſt, according to our Saviours words expreſly.</p>
               <p>Now that the Father gives theſe to the Son for that end that they may be aſſiſted by him to perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe, will (I conceive) appear by what will follow by and by. The Fathers giving theſe to the Son, doth not ſuppoſe them to have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Son, when he gives them to him, but the contrary. For the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giving them to the Son, is ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to their coming to him: for Chriſt ſaith all that the Father giveth me, <hi>ſhall</hi> come unto me, not <hi>are</hi> come unto me. And to what end do they come to him, but to learn of him, and be taught by him how to be ſaved? <hi>i.e.</hi> to perform the condition on which ſalvation is promiſed.</p>
               <p>For that I take to be the meaning of the Fathers giving theſe to the Son, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:96825:130"/>his committing them to him to be made Diſciples by him, to be taught and enabled to do that on which ſalvation is promiſed.</p>
               <p>Not that the Fathers thus giving theſe to the Son to be aſſiſted by him, is ſo to be underſtood, as if the Father did wholly remit them to the Son, and did not ſtill continue to aſſiſt them by the ſame Spirit by which he prepared them for him at the firſt. For that <hi>faith</hi> by which they perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe, is <hi>the gift of God,</hi> and thoſe who are regenerated, <hi>are born of God;</hi> and <hi>it is God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in them both to will and to do,</hi> even when they perform the condition of the promiſe in the beſt manner that ever it is performed. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are to direct our prayers to the Father for the Holy Spirit, and for all the aſſiſtances and fruits of it. But thoſe prepared by the Father, are ſaid to be given to the Son, in order to their being brought by him to believe the Goſpel; becauſe the diſpenſing of all
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96825:131"/>Evangelical aſſiſtances, and of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace, is committed to the Son; but yet ſo as that the Father gives this by the Son, as the Son alſo does by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this matter we muſt know, that after our Saviours humiliation, came his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Father, who gave unto him as Mediatour God-man, a Kingdom glory and greatneſs, all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, <hi>he gave all things into his hands, Joh.</hi> 3.35. <hi>committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son, Joh.</hi> 5.22. The Father committed to the Son the whole Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Oeconomy, the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging all affairs belonging to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and well-being of the Church which he had purchaſed with his own bloud, over which he made him head; yea, head alſo over all things to the Church; for he made him Prince of the Kings of the Earth, the onely Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:96825:131"/>
               <p>This authority and power is ſaid to be given to Chriſt, <hi>becauſe he is the Son of man; John</hi> 5.27. that is, I conceive, becauſe he is the Meſſiah, to whom ſuch a Kingdom and Regal power was promiſed and foretold in the Prophets, under that denomination of the <hi>Son of Man.</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw in a Viſion <hi>one like the Son of man, to whom the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of days gave dominion, glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations, and Languages might ſerve him, Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. And <hi>Son of Man</hi> is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation which our Saviour as the Meſſiah, doth frequently give unto himſelf, as is recorded in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Hiſtory, and which S. <hi>John</hi> in his Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> doth alſo more than once give him. And <hi>Iſaias</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning <hi>a child that ſhould be born, that the Government ſhould be upon his ſhoulders, upon the throne of David and upon his Kingdom to order and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it for ever, chap.</hi> 9.6, 7. To which agrees that of the Angel to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33, 34. <hi>The Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96825:132"/>of his father David, and he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> All agreeing that this Kingdom, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Power, ſhould be adminiſtred by the Son of God in humane nature, and becauſe he is the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>Now in this gift of the Father, the giving ſuch to his Son as he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to become his Diſciples, and to be made ſo by him, is included; they are part of the <hi>all</hi> things which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put into his hand. In giving him a Kingdom, he gives him a people to be his Subjects, whoſe good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and whoſe happineſs he is to provide for, and to promote by his ſpiritual Government. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ſpoken of Gods ſetting his Son upon his holy hill of <hi>Zion, Pſal.</hi> 2.6. in <hi>verſe</hi> 8. he brings in God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to him; <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Theſe are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Father to become Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96825:132"/>to the Son then when he gives them to him; but are actually made ſubject to his Spiritual Government by the Son himſelf, by his <hi>going forth conquering and to conquer</hi> by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; it <hi>is by his arrows the people fall under him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Fathers thus committing to his Son the power of managing all matters that concern the forming and perfecting one Chriſtian Church throughout the World, and ſo of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing all aids and aſſiſtances to that end, doth not imply or ſuppoſe the Fathers relinquiſhing this power, but his doing all by his Son, as deſigning to intereſs the Man Chriſt Jeſus in all theſe great affairs. And thus when the Father ſends the Holy Spirit, by whoſe influences we receive our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he then ſends him in the name of the Son, as being concerned with him in ſuch ſending; <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt whom the Father will ſend in my name,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. And on the other
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96825:133"/>hand, the Son when he ſends the Holy Spirit, he ſends him as from the Father who is always concerned alſo in ſuch ſending, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. <hi>When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as I ſay, the Father diſpenſeth the influences and aſſiſtances of the Spirit <hi>by the Son,</hi> as God-man, now in the time of this Kingdom of his which the Father hath given him. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of Gods ſaving us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſaith he, he ſhed on us abundantly, <hi>through</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. I thank my God always on your behalf, for <hi>the grace of God which is given you by Jeſus Chriſt; that in every thing ye are enriched by him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5. And becauſe theſe aids are thus diſpenſed by the Son, though from the Father, and by the Holy Ghoſt, they are called <hi>the ſupplies of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96825:133"/>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>And it is God that ſupplies all our need, according to his riches in glory,</hi> but it is <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 4.19. And the Holy Spirit is ſtiled the <hi>Spirit of the Son,</hi> even then when he is ſent into our hearts by the Father, for the reaſon aforeſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. And ſo for the gifts and graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they are all diſpenſed by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>To every one of us</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is given grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt. Epheſ.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p>All this I have noted, that we might the better underſtand for what reaſon and in what reſpect thoſe prepared to receive the Faith of the Goſpel, are ſaid to be given by the Father to the Son to work that faith in them: and it is becauſe in giving him the Mediatory Kingdom, he gives him the power of diſpenſing all thoſe aids and aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by which men are made true and ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But to proceed yet a little further in this matter, the uſe of which, as to the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96825:134"/>principal ſcope of this Chapter, will be better diſcerned afterward: the reaſon why the Father confers this Regal dignity and authority upon the Son, and the power of ſending the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of diſpenſing aids and gifts, is not onely that <hi>all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father,</hi> which yet is one reaſon of it, <hi>John</hi> 5.23. Nor yet onely as a reward of his deep humiliation, ſuffering, and obedience unto death, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10. but alſo that Gods great deſign of reforming the World by ſending his Son into it, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ſinners to the faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpel, might by that means be facilitated, as tending to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt the more glorious, and the more attractive an object of Faith. It is by his being thus exalted, that men are more eſpecially brought to believe in him. It is <hi>by him that we do believe in God that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory that our faith and hope might be in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. So that we ſee this glorious advancement
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96825:134"/>of Chriſt, hath the nature of an <hi>aid</hi> in it to help us to believe.</p>
               <p>The meanneſs of our Saviours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World while he was in it, and his crucifixion at the laſt, was that which prejudiced men againſt both him and his doctrine; it was their ſtumbling block, and that at which they were offended, and all through a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of the nature of Chriſts Kingdom and Government; ſo that he had but very few Diſciples at laſt, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his mighty miracles and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words. But when he was raiſed from the dead, and exalted in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and glory, and had given a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful demonſtration of it by ſending the Holy Ghoſt, as he had promiſed he would, to enable thoſe that preached in his name, and thoſe that believed in his name, to do ſo many wonderful things in his name as they did: this proof of his exaltation, in a ſhort time filled a great part of the World with Diſciples to him, and made men flock by multitudes into his Church and Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:96825:135"/>
               <p>This effect of his glorious exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was foretold by the Prophets. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, more than the womb of the morning,</hi> according to the marginal reading, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Theſe words, <hi>more than the womb of the morning,</hi> ſeem to be hyperbolical, to ſhew the vaſt numbers of Diſciples and Subjects, the day of Chriſts power and glorious exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhould procure him, even like the drops of the morning-dew for multitude. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were to the Meſſiah, of whom he propheſied, ſaid, <hi>Nations that knew thee not ſhall run unto thee, becauſe of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Iſrael, for he hath glorified thee, Iſa.</hi> 55.5. That is the reaſon we ſee of the Nations running in unto him; it is becauſe Almighty God hath <hi>glorified</hi> him, <hi>exalted, extolled, and made him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high,</hi> as the ſame Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 52.13.</p>
               <p>When men perceived that the God of Heaven ſo far approved of what
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96825:135"/>Chriſt had taught, done, and ſuffered in the World, as to reward him for it with ſuch power and glory, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from them a belief of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and put a great reputation upon it: it raiſed in men alſo a great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation from him as from one that was very well able to prefer and reward his friends and followers, as he had promiſed he would.</p>
               <p>We find that the ſending of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, the pouring out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thoſe greater meaſures foretold by the Prophets, was deferred unto this time of the glorious exaltation of Chriſt. So ſaith the Evangeliſt S. <hi>John</hi> 7.39. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> And the reaſon hereof was, that he might have the honour of ſending him, and of diſpenſing the aſſiſtances and manifold gifts of the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by convince men that he was the ſame which he always declared himſelf to be, the Son of God ſent down from Heaven. <hi>If I go not away the Comforter
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96825:136"/>will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you. And when he is come, he ſhall convince the World of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to the Father and ye ſee me no more. John</hi> 16.7, 8, 10. Convince the World of righteouſneſs, that is, he ſhould convince them that Chriſt was no deceiver, as they accuſed him to be here on Earth, but the true Meſſiah, Son of God and Saviour of the World, as he had declared himſelf to be while he was here in the World. And this our Saviour ſays the Holy Ghoſt ſhould convince the World of, becauſe of his going to the Father: that is, by the Fathers receiving him up into glory after his reſurrection and placing him there in royal Majeſty. This our Saviour ſays the Spirit ſhould convince the World of when he was come from him; and the event plainly declares how.</p>
               <p>For within a few days after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours aſcenſion into Heaven, and his enthronation there, he ſends down the Holy Ghoſt upon his Apoſtles that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96825:136"/>preached in his name and were his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and upon others alſo that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his name, enabling them by the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeak and do ſuch things, as by hearing and ſeeing of which, great multitudes were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the true Meſſiah and Saviour of the World, about three thouſand of them being baptized into this Faith the very ſame day in which the Holy Ghoſt was thus ſent by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For S. <hi>Peter</hi> diſcourſed to them of this wonderful event thus, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.32, 33. <hi>This Jeſus</hi> (of whom he had been ſpeaking) <hi>hath God raiſed up, whereof we all are witneſſes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received from the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> The end and deſign of all which, was to convince men that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Chriſt of God; which was done by convincing them that God had thus exalted him and given this
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96825:137"/>power of doing theſe wonders by the Spirit he had ſent. For that is the uſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> drew it to, <hi>Verſe</hi> 36. <hi>Therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this ſending of the Holy Ghoſt was ſo neceſſary to qualifie the Apoſtles for the great work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the World by preaching Chriſt and his doctrine, and for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring credit to be given to it, that our Saviour would not have them ſo much as ſet upon it, or go about it, <hi>but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to tarry at Jeruſalem until they were endued with this power from on high, Luke</hi> 24.49. And the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel under this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, was doubtleſs the preaching it <hi>in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>Now by this we ſee how thoſe aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which men receive in believing,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96825:137"/>and ſo in performing the condition of the promiſe, do depend upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giving all things into the hands of the Son: and how for that reaſon the Father gives ſuch as have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively aſſiſted by him, unto the Son to be compleatly aſſiſted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition of the promiſe. And indeed the reaſon why ſo many turned to God in ſo little a time after Chriſts exaltation, than ever was known before, was becauſe thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances then diſpenſed by him, were more and greater than ever were vouchſafed the World before.</p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould be diſcouraged, or think their condition worſe than indeed it is, for that we have no ſuch external aſſiſtances by the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, as men in thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times had, let this one thing be conſidered; That the Chriſtians now are as really aſſiſted by that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Holy Ghoſt which was in thoſe times, as thoſe were who lived then; ſuppoſing the truth of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96825:138"/>of it, of which there is no cauſe to doubt. For we have the ſame Goſpel as they had, and that under the ſame evidence by which it was demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them to be from Heaven, and that the then glorified Jeſus was the author of it. And we may as truly be ſaid to have Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles now in reſpect of external aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as the Jews in thoſe times were to have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. For we have the ſame doctrine which Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached, and many of the ſame miracles which they wrought to confirm it, tranſmitted down to us by their writings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable tradition; and the Jews had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in our Saviours time, when he ſaid they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. The miracles of the Apoſtles then, wrought the ſame effect, procured the ſame belief of their doctrine, in many that onely heard of them by credible teſtimony, as they did in them that ſaw them done. We ſee our Saviour upbraided his Diſciples for not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96825:138"/>matter of Fact, when teſtified to them by credible eye-witneſſes. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14. <hi>And he ſaid to Thomas, bleſſed are they which have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> And when S. <hi>John</hi> had written a Hiſtory of ſome of the ſigns or miracles which our Saviour did, he ſays, <hi>theſe are written that men might believe, John</hi> 20.30, 31. By this he ſuppoſed his written teſtimony of what he had ſeen and heard, to be a competent ground of faith in others. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hold faſt the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ye have been taught, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or our Epiſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>But although it is not neceſſary that the ſame miraculous operations of the Holy Spirit, ſhould be repeated in every Age, to convince men that Chriſt, who was firſt crucified, is now advanced to the throne of his glory, and hath the power of ſending the Holy Ghoſt to confirm the doctrine which was preached in his name by them who proved their miſſion from
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96825:139"/>him by ſigns and wonders, and mighty deeds which were done in his name: though, as I ſay, the repetition of theſe be not neceſſary in every Age, this having been done <hi>once for all</hi> in one Age, as S. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of the Faith <hi>once delivered to the Saints;</hi> yet the inward aſſiſtance by the Spirit, to cauſe the external aſſiſtances to operate the more effectually upon the mind, is ſtill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and is ſtill continued in the Church. For in this reſpect our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by his Spirit as well as by his word, is with his people always to the end of the World, as he promiſed he would, and as he promiſed his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit likewiſe ſhould. <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth. John</hi> 14.16. It was this preſence of Chriſt, I conceive, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired might be and continue with <hi>Timothies</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.22. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with thy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this part of my Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96825:139"/>Divine Aſſiſtance, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew, that our Lord and Saviour hath the power of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Evangelical and Spiritual Aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed to him by the Father, and that that is the reaſon why the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſaid to give ſuch to the Son as have heard and learned of the Father. And now this high advancement of the Son, and his having all power in Heaven and Earth given to him, leaves no place for us to doubt of his ability to aſſiſt thoſe to the uttermoſt, who do not make themſelves uncapable of it, by refuſing to make uſe of it, and of the Fathers preparatory aſſiſtance. And truly all ſuch have no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon neither to doubt of our Saviours willingneſs to aſſiſt them, than they have of his power, if theſe few things following be but duly conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Kingdom, Glory, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forementioned, and the power of diſpenſing aids and aſſiſtances is given by the Father to the Son for this very end among others, that he might uſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96825:140"/>and manage all for the bringing men, ſuch as the Father hath given him, to perform the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in repenting, in believing, and obeying the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his own right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The father advanced him to that high honour and dignity, that he might be a publick good to mankind, in aſſiſting them to perform the condition of the promiſe, as he had been before by his humiliation for the obtaining of the promiſe upon that condition, that ſo he might be a compleat Saviour in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us as well from ſin in the power and pollution of it, as from the guilt of it. <hi>He aſcended far above all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that he might fill</hi> or fulfil <hi>all things, Epheſ.</hi> 4.10. That he might fully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence and beſtow whatever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the perfecting of the Saints and edification of the body of Chriſt. The Apoſtle having ſaid in <hi>chap.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>that God having raiſed Chriſt from the dead, ſet him at his own right hand in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96825:140"/>the heavenly places, far above all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and power, might and dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this World, but alſo in that which is to come; and having put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet;</hi> then in Verſe 22, and 23. he ſays, <hi>he gave him to be head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> He did not onely give him to be the Head of his Church, but to be Head over all things to the Church, to the uſe and benefit of the Church; for the fulneſs of this power of his in the iſſue and benefit of it, runs in to his Church for whom he received it, and in reſpect whereof, the Church is his fulneſs in a paſſive ſenſe: for it is he <hi>that filleth all in all,</hi> as S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>of his fulneſs we have all received, and grace for grace, John</hi> 1.16. ſuch a fulneſs as holds ſome proportion with the fulneſs of ſuch a head: all the fulneſs wherewith all and every one of his Church are filled, is derived from him, it is all of his ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that as he is Head of the Church, and Head over all things to the Church.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:96825:141"/>
               <p>For he is not onely a political Head to the Church to govern it by Laws, but ſuch a Head alſo as reſembles a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural head by way of influence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying by his Spirit a vital and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power unto all the members, to enable them to obey thoſe Laws. The whole body hath <hi>from this head nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment miniſtred,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſhews <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. Upon which account S. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me. But without him</hi> (as our Saviour told his Diſciples) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if all this fulneſs, all this power we have been ſpeaking of, was given to the Son, was put into his hands for that end that he ſhould uſe it, and manage it in aiding and aſſiſting thoſe whom the Father hath given him, to perform the condition on which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and eternal life are promiſed, there is no queſtion to be made of his willingneſs to uſe it to that end, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we further conſider that which follows.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:96825:141"/>
               <p n="2">2. For in the ſecond place, he is as faithful as he is able, faithful to uſe the fulneſs of his ſufficiency for the ends and uſes for which he received it. <hi>He is faithful to him that appointed him, in all his houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.2. <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>All,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that the Father giveth me, ſhall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out, John</hi> 6.37. When he was leaving the World, he could with all confidence ſay unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do, Joh.</hi> 17. And if he did thus in the day of his humiliation and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, it cannot be thought but that he will likewiſe finiſh what the Father hath given him to do now in the day of his exaltation and power. Why do the holy Angels ſing, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength?</hi> but becauſe he faithfully uſeth them for thoſe noble and worthy ends for which he received them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96825:142"/>and received gifts for men,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. he then <hi>gave gifts unto men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10. When upon his glorious exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he had received the promiſe of the Father, to wit, the power of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt, he preſently pours it out upon his Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. what he receives for us, he will be ſure to communicate to us. <hi>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the earth,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.3. for that is the end of their being ſo filled, to ſupply the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the inhabitants of the earth. They indeed do thus by a natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; but our Saviour out of his fulneſs ſupplies the ſpiritual wants of men ſpontaneouſly. Never was the kindeſt Mother more willing that her full breſts ſhould be drawn by her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Infant, than our bleſſed Saviour is that we ſhould draw and derive from his fulneſs to the relief and ſupply of all our ſpiritual wants to make us good and happy.</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:96825:142"/>
               <p>To think or to ſuſpect that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould with-hold any of that <hi>aid</hi> from men which he hath received for them, and which is neceſſary to enable them to perform the condition of the promiſe, ſuppoſing them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, would be highly to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. It is a grievous thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, to with-hold from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that which their extream neceſſity calls for, when it is in ones power to relieve them without injury to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or to his, or to the publick. <hi>He that with-holdeth corn, the people ſhall curſe him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 11.26. The reverence which we owe to our bleſſed Saviour, and the aſſurance we have of his goodneſs and good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, will not ſuffer us once to think there is in him any thing of like nature. And if he himſelf threatned that unprofitable ſervant in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as he did, for not uſing the talent committed to him, to the end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which he received it, we may be ſure he himſelf will be very far from not diſcharging the truſt he hath received from his Father.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:96825:143"/>
               <p n="3">3. We have no reaſon to fear or to doubt but that that compaſſion and love towards us, and the longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Saviour had after our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made him willing to ſuffer ſo much as he hath, to obtain a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pardon for us, and a conditional promiſe of it, doth and will make him willing to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> all thoſe in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that condition, who have not, or do not make themſelves unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, by not uſing, but oppoſing ſuch preparatory aids as have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them. He who hath laid ſo coſtly a foundation in his own bloud, to make us good and happy, cannot, as we may well think, be wanting to build upon that foundation what is neceſſary on his part to compleat his deſign of grace and favour towards us. We cannot think he will be willing to loſe all the coſt he hath already expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards the procuring of pardon and life for us, for want of doing that further for us, which he can with far more eaſe do, (if we have not made ourſelves uncapable of it) than what he hath done already.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:96825:143"/>
               <p>Hath our bleſſed Saviour any thing to give us which is better than himſelf, or more dear to him? And if not, as doubtleſs he hath not, then we may confidently conclude, that that which put him upon giving himſelf for us, will not ſuffer him to keep back from us that which he can give us without any detriment to himſelf, or diſparagement to his wiſdom, unleſs we have made our ſelves uncapable of it. As S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of God the Father, he that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things? ſo we may ſay of God the Son; he that ſpared not himſelf when we ſtood in need of a Saviour, but gave himſelf to death for us; how ſhall he not give us that alſo, which though it be leſs for him to give, yet is ſuch which in ſome ſort we ſtand in as much need of as we did of a Saviour, his aſſiſtance I mean. <hi>If when we were enemies we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> as the Apoſtle inferrs,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96825:144"/>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</bibl> If meerly by Chriſts dying for our ſins, we were thus far reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Gods favour, as that he was pleaſed to propoſe to us free and eaſie conditions of mercy and pardon; much more eaſie will it be, and moſt agreeable to that former eſſay of his goodneſs, now he hath gone ſo far with us, to beſtow on us alſo ability to perform thoſe conditions (unleſs we have made our ſelves uncapable of it) ſince without ſuch aſſiſtance,</q> all the reſt would ſignifie no more to us, than as if Chriſt had never died for us, nor than as if ſuch conditions had never been obtained for us, or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That plenitude of power and ſufficiency lodged in our Saviour, to anſwer and to ſupply all the ſpiritual wants and neceſſities of men, on whoſe behalf our Saviour took on him the great office of Mediator, will never turn to ſuch an account of glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and praiſe to God the Father of all mercies, while it is reſtrained and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96825:144"/>kept back onely within himſelf, as it will when communicated and given forth in the effects of it, to them for whoſe benefit he received it: nor will it till then neither redound ſo much to his own honour as God the Father deſigned it ſhould. And if not, how can we poſſibly think there ſhould be any thing of unwillingneſs in him to afford all thoſe his aſſiſtance to perform the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, who do not refuſe to make uſe of it?</p>
               <p>For as it was the deſign of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in all the good he did to men while he was in the World, to gain glory thereby unto his Father, ſo it was a great inducement to him to do that good, when he knew it would turn to ſuch an account. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Son, John</hi> 14.13. It was matter of great ſatisfaction to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when he was upon leaving the World, that he could ſay to his Father,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96825:145"/>
                  <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. John</hi> 17.4. he took pleaſure in doing that work for that reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he glorified the Father thereby. And we cannot think he is leſs zealous for the honour of his Father now he is ſo highly exalted by him, than he was in the day of his humiliation and temptation.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then that our Saviours aſſiſting us to perform the condition of the promiſe, will in ſeveral reſpects bring in a great revenue of glory to God, as well as it will of good to men, we may be conſident that he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be grieved for that men are no more forward to make uſe of his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than any way backward to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it them.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it a prevailing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to obtain a liberal contribution for the relief of fellow-Chriſtians, when he could ſay, it would both <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the neceſſities of the Saints, and cauſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96825:145"/>many thanksgivings unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.12. Now our Saviours aſſiſting men to perform the condition of the promiſe, will not onely make <hi>them</hi> happy, but will alſo fill their hearts and mouths with many and many thankſgivings unto God, for his grace beſtowed on them by Jeſus Chriſt. And if ſo, we cannot doubt of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours willingneſs to aſſiſt all thoſe who are any whit willing to be aſſiſted. Charity in good men will make them willing to engage in ſuch an action as will both relieve men, and procure many thankſgivings unto God, though they do thereby to a degree empty themſelves, and diminiſh of their own ſtore. How much more then will that goodneſs in our Saviour, which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater, diſpoſe him to yield us his aſſiſtance to become good in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition of the promiſe, when he ſhall thereby both glorifie his Father, and make us happy, and procure to himſelf the ſatisfaction of doing all this good, and everlaſting love and praiſe from thoſe that are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96825:146"/>made happy by it; and all this too without any more diminiſhing of his own riches, than when by a word of his mouth he healed the diſeaſed bodies of men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The pleaſure which our Saviour takes in mens becoming good, as they do by performing the condition of the promiſe, is a ground of great aſſurance, that nothing ſhall be wanting on his part, fully to aſſiſt them to perform that condition, that will conſiſt with his wiſdom and with the terms on which the Father will have men to be ſo aſſiſted. The Prophet ſpeaking of the Meſſiah, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed, and he ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied. Iſa.</hi> 53. To ſee the fruit of his Mediatory performance in mens being recovered from being bad to become good, from Rebels to become obedi nt Subjects, yea dutiful children to his Father, and ſo heirs of ſalvation, is and needs muſt be matter of great ſatisfaction to the ſoul of our Saviour, becauſe it is the very prize for which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96825:146"/>he ran, the deſign of his whole under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as Mediatour. And therefore he cannot poſſibly be wanting in any thing that is but fit for him to do to help men to become good, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition of the promiſe, which is the ſame. We ſee by his weeping over Jeruſalem, how he is grieved when men refuſe to make uſe of thoſe helps and means of deliverance which he hath obtained for them at a coſtly rate; when they refuſe to be holpen out of the pit of deſtruction, when help is offered them. By which we may eaſily judge how acceptable it is to him to help and aſſiſt them to get out of a ſinful ſtate, who have any mind to be ſo aſſiſted by him.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations are enough and ſufficient, I conceive, to ſatisfie us tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our Saviours willingneſs to aſſiſt thoſe to perform the condition of the promiſe, who do not remain unwilling to be ſo aſſiſted by him, after what God has been doing in their ſouls to make them willing: and greatly tend like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96825:147"/>to ſtrengthen their faith in Chriſt, and to encourage their dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for all neceſſary ſupplies of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and grace, who have any mind to become good, or to increaſe in goodneſs, and to put forth their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to that end.</p>
